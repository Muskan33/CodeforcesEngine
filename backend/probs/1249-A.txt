A. Yet Another Dividing into Teamstime 1 secondmemory 256 You are a coach of a group consisting of $$$n$$$ students. The $$$i$$$-th student has programming skill $$$a_i$$$. All students have distinct programming skills. You want to divide them into teams in such a way that:  No two students $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ such that $$$|a_i - a_j| = 1$$$ belong to the same team (i.e. skills of each pair of students in the same team have the difference strictly greater than $$$1$$$);  the number of teams is the minimum possible. You have to answer $$$q$$$ independent queries.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le 100$$$) — the number of queries. Then $$$q$$$ queries follow.The first line of the query contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$) — the number of students in the query. The second line of the query contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 100$$$, all $$$a_i$$$ are distinct), where $$$a_i$$$ is the programming skill of the $$$i$$$-th student.OutputFor each query, print the answer on it — the minimum number of teams you can form if no two students $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ such that $$$|a_i - a_j| = 1$$$ may belong to the same team (i.e. skills of each pair of students in the same team has the difference strictly greater than $$$1$$$     math      *800
