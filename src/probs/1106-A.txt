A. Lunar New Year and Cross Countingtime 2  256 Lunar New Year is approaching, and you bought a matrix with lots of "crosses".This matrix $$$M$$$ of size $$$n \times n$$$ contains only 'X' and '.' (without quotes). The element in the $$$i$$$-th row and the $$$j$$$-th column $$$(i, j)$$$ is defined as $$$M(i, j)$$$, where $$$1 \leq i, j \leq n$$$. We define a cross appearing in the $$$i$$$-th row and the $$$j$$$-th column ($$$1 < i, j < n$$$) if and only if $$$M(i, j) = M(i - 1, j - 1) = M(i - 1, j + 1) = M(i + 1, j - 1) = M(i + 1, j + 1) = $$$ 'X'.The following figure illustrates a cross appearing at position $$$(2, 2)$$$ in a $$$3 \times 3$$$ matrix. X.X.X.X.X Your task is to find out the number of crosses in the given matrix $$$M$$$. Two crosses are different if and only if they appear in different rows or columns.InputThe first line contains only one positive integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 500$$$), denoting the size of the matrix $$$M$$$.The following $$$n$$$ lines illustrate the matrix $$$M$$$. Each line contains exactly $$$n$$$ characters, each of them is 'X' or '.'. The $$$j$$$-th element in the $$$i$$$-th line represents $$$M(i, j)$$$, where $$$1 \leq i, j \leq n$$$.OutputOutput a single line containing only one integer number $$$k$$$ â€” the number of crosses in the given matrix $$$M$$$.     implementation      *800
