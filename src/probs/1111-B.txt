B. Average Superhero Gang Power time 1 secondmemory 256 Every superhero has been given a power value by the Felicity Committee. The avengers crew wants to maximize the average power of the superheroes in their team by performing certain operations.Initially, there are $$$n$$$ superheroes in avengers team having powers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$, respectively. In one operation, they can remove one superhero from their team (if there are at least two) or they can increase the power of a superhero by $$$1$$$. They can do at most $$$m$$$ operations. Also, on a particular superhero at most $$$k$$$ operations can be done.Can you help the avengers team to maximize the average power of their crew?InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^{5}$$$, $$$1 \le k \le 10^{5}$$$, $$$1 \le m \le 10^{7}$$$) — the number of superheroes, the maximum number of times you can increase power of a particular superhero, and the total maximum number of operations.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^{6}$$$) — the initial powers of the superheroes in the cast of avengers.OutputOutput a single number — the maximum final average power.Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $$$10^{-6}$$$.Formally, let your answer be $$$a$$$, and the jury's answer be $$$b$$$. Your answer is accepted if and only if $$$\frac{|a - b|}{\max{(1, |b|)}} \le 10^{-6}$$$.     brute force      implementation      math      *1700
