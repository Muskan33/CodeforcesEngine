H. Securitytime 4  512 Some programming website is establishing a secure communication protocol. For security reasons, they want to choose several more or less random strings.Initially, they have a string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Now they want to choose $$$q$$$ strings using the following steps, and you are to help them.  A string $$$x$$$ consisting of lowercase English letters and integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq |s|$$$) are chosen.  Consider all non-empty distinct substrings of the $$$s_l s_{l + 1} \ldots s_r$$$, that is all distinct strings $$$s_i s_{i+1} \ldots s_{j}$$$ where $$$l \le i \le j \le r$$$. Among all of them choose all strings that are lexicographically greater than $$$x$$$.  If there are no such strings, you should print $$$-1$$$. Otherwise print the lexicographically smallest among them. String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$, if either $$$a$$$ is a prefix of $$$b$$$ and $$$a \ne b$$$, or there exists such a position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le min(|a|, |b|)$$$), such that $$$a_i < b_i$$$ and for all $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \le j < i$$$) $$$a_j = b_j$$$. Here $$$|a|$$$ denotes the length of the string $$$a$$$.InputThe first line of input contains a non-empty string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \leq |s| \leq 10^{5}$$$) consisting of lowercase English letters.The second line contains an integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of strings to select.Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq |s|$$$) and a non-empty string $$$x$$$ consisting of lowercase English letters. The total length of strings $$$x$$$ for all queries does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^{5}$$$.OutputOutput $$$q$$$ lines, each of them should contain the desired string or $$$-1$$$, if there is no such string.     data structures      string suffix structures      *3200
