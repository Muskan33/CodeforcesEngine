I. Say Hellotime 2  256 Two friends are travelling through Bubble galaxy. They say "Hello!" via signals to each other if their distance is smaller or equal than $$$d_1$$$ and   it's the first time they speak to each other or   at some point in time after their last talk their distance was greater than $$$d_2$$$. We need to calculate how many times friends said "Hello!" to each other. For $$$N$$$ moments, you'll have an array of points for each friend representing their positions at that moment. A person can stay in the same position between two moments in time, but if a person made a move we assume this movement as movement with constant speed in constant direction.InputThe first line contains one integer number $$$N$$$ ($$$2 \leq N \leq 100\,000$$$) representing number of moments in which we captured positions for two friends.The second line contains two integer numbers $$$d_1$$$ and $$$d_2 \ (0 < d_1 < d_2 < 1000)$$$. The next $$$N$$$ lines contains four integer numbers $$$A_x,A_y,B_x,B_y$$$ ($$$0 \leq A_x, A_y, B_x, B_y \leq 1000$$$) representing coordinates of friends A and B in each captured moment.OutputOutput contains one integer number that represents how many times friends will say "Hello!" to each other     geometry      *2300
