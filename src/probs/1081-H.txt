H. Palindromic Magictime 2.5  1024 After learning some fancy algorithms about palindromes, Chouti found palindromes very interesting, so he wants to challenge you with this problem.Chouti has got two strings $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$. Since he likes palindromes, he would like to pick $$$a$$$ as some non-empty palindromic substring of $$$A$$$ and $$$b$$$ as some non-empty palindromic substring of $$$B$$$. Concatenating them, he will get string $$$ab$$$.Chouti thinks strings he could get this way are interesting, so he wants to know how many different strings he can get.InputThe first line contains a single string $$$A$$$ ($$$1 \le |A| \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).The second line contains a single string $$$B$$$ ($$$1 \le |B| \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).Strings $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ contain only lowercase English letters.OutputThe first and only line should contain a single integer — the number of possible strings.     data structures      hashing      strings      *3500
