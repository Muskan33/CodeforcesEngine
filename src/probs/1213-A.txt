A. Chips Movingtime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given $$$n$$$ chips on a number line. The $$$i$$$-th chip is placed at the integer coordinate $$$x_i$$$. Some chips can have equal coordinates.You can perform each of the two following types of moves any (possibly, zero) number of times on any chip:  Move the chip $$$i$$$ by $$$2$$$ to the left or $$$2$$$ to the right for free (i.e. replace the current coordinate $$$x_i$$$ with $$$x_i - 2$$$ or with $$$x_i + 2$$$);  move the chip $$$i$$$ by $$$1$$$ to the left or $$$1$$$ to the right and pay one coin for this move (i.e. replace the current coordinate $$$x_i$$$ with $$$x_i - 1$$$ or with $$$x_i + 1$$$). Note that it's allowed to move chips to any integer coordinate, including negative and zero.Your task is to find the minimum total number of coins required to move all $$$n$$$ chips to the same coordinate (i.e. all $$$x_i$$$ should be equal after some sequence of moves).InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$) — the number of chips.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$$$ ($$$1 \le x_i \le 10^9$$$), where $$$x_i$$$ is the coordinate of the $$$i$$$-th chip.OutputPrint one integer — the minimum total number of coins required to move all $$$n$$$ chips to the same coordinate.     math      *900
