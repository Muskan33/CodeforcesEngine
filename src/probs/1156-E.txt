E. Special Segments of Permutationtime 2  512 You are given a permutation $$$p$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ occurs exactly once).Let's call some subsegment $$$p[l, r]$$$ of this permutation special if $$$p_l + p_r = \max \limits_{i = l}^{r} p_i$$$. Please calculate the number of special subsegments.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1$$$, $$$p_2$$$, ..., $$$p_n$$$ ($$$1 \le p_i \le n$$$). All these integers are pairwise distinct.OutputPrint the number of special subsegments of the given permutation.     data structures      divide and conquer      dsu      two pointers      *2200
