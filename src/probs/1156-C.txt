C. Match Pointstime 2  256 You are given a set of points $$$x_1$$$, $$$x_2$$$, ..., $$$x_n$$$ on the number line.Two points $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ can be matched with each other if the following conditions hold:  neither $$$i$$$ nor $$$j$$$ is matched with any other point;  $$$|x_i - x_j| \ge z$$$. What is the maximum number of pairs of points you can match with each other?InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$z$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \le z \le 10^9$$$) — the number of points and the constraint on the distance between matched points, respectively.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1$$$, $$$x_2$$$, ..., $$$x_n$$$ ($$$1 \le x_i \le 10^9$$$).OutputPrint one integer — the maximum number of pairs of points you can match with each other.     binary search      greedy      sortings      ternary search      two pointers      *2000
