G. Greedy Subsequencestime 2  256 For some array $$$c$$$, let's denote a greedy subsequence as a sequence of indices $$$p_1$$$, $$$p_2$$$, ..., $$$p_l$$$ such that $$$1 \le p_1 < p_2 < \dots < p_l \le |c|$$$, and for each $$$i \in [1, l - 1]$$$, $$$p_{i + 1}$$$ is the minimum number such that $$$p_{i + 1} > p_i$$$ and $$$c[p_{i + 1}] > c[p_i]$$$.You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$. For each its subsegment of length $$$k$$$, calculate the length of its longest greedy subsequence.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le k \le n \le 10^6$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$ and the length of subsegments.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$) — array $$$a$$$.OutputPrint $$$n - k + 1$$$ integers — the maximum lengths of greedy subsequences of each subsegment having length $$$k$$$. The first number should correspond to subsegment $$$a[1..k]$$$, the second — to subsegment $$$a[2..k + 1]$$$, and so on.     data structures      dp      trees      *2400
