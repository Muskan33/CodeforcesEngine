G. Two-Pathstime 3.5  256 You are given a weighted tree (undirected connected graph with no cycles, loops or multiple edges) with $$$n$$$ vertices. The edge $$$\{u_j, v_j\}$$$ has weight $$$w_j$$$. Also each vertex $$$i$$$ has its own value $$$a_i$$$ assigned to it.Let's call a path starting in vertex $$$u$$$ and ending in vertex $$$v$$$, where each edge can appear no more than twice (regardless of direction), a 2-path. Vertices can appear in the 2-path multiple times (even start and end vertices).For some 2-path $$$p$$$ profit $$$\text{Pr}(p) = \sum\limits_{v \in \text{distinct vertices in } p}{a_v} - \sum\limits_{e \in \text{distinct edges in } p}{k_e \cdot w_e}$$$, where $$$k_e$$$ is the number of times edge $$$e$$$ appears in $$$p$$$. That is, vertices are counted once, but edges are counted the number of times they appear in $$$p$$$.You are about to answer $$$m$$$ queries. Each query is a pair of vertices $$$(qu, qv)$$$. For each query find 2-path $$$p$$$ from $$$qu$$$ to $$$qv$$$ with maximal profit $$$\text{Pr}(p)$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \le q \le 4 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of queries.The second line contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ $$$(1 \le a_i \le 10^9)$$$ — the values of the vertices.Next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contain descriptions of edges: each line contains three space separated integers $$$u_i$$$, $$$v_i$$$ and $$$w_i$$$ ($$$1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$$$, $$$u_i \neq v_i$$$, $$$1 \le w_i \le 10^9$$$) — there is edge $$$\{u_i, v_i\}$$$ with weight $$$w_i$$$ in the tree.Next $$$q$$$ lines contain queries (one per line). Each query contains two integers $$$qu_i$$$ and $$$qv_i$$$ $$$(1 \le qu_i, qv_i \le n)$$$ — endpoints of the 2-path you need to find.OutputFor each query print one integer per line — maximal profit $$$\text{Pr}(p)$$$ of the some 2-path $$$p$$$ with the corresponding endpoints     data structures      dp      trees      *2700
