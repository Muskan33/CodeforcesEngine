C. Liebig's Barrelstime 2  256 You have m = n·k wooden staves. The i-th stave has length ai. You have to assemble n barrels consisting of k staves each, you can use any k staves to construct a barrel. Each stave must belong to exactly one barrel.Let volume vj of barrel j be equal to the length of the minimal stave in it.  You want to assemble exactly n barrels with the maximal total sum of volumes. But you have to make them equal enough, so a difference between volumes of any pair of the resulting barrels must not exceed l, i.e. |vx - vy| ≤ l for any 1 ≤ x ≤ n and 1 ≤ y ≤ n.Print maximal total sum of volumes of equal enough barrels or 0 if it's impossible to satisfy the condition above.InputThe first line contains three space-separated integers n, k and l (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 105, 1 ≤ n·k ≤ 105, 0 ≤ l ≤ 109).The second line contains m = n·k space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — lengths of staves.OutputPrint single integer — maximal total sum of the volumes of barrels or 0 if it's impossible to construct exactly n barrels satisfying the condition |vx - vy| ≤ l for any 1 ≤ x ≤ n and 1 ≤ y ≤ n.     greedy      *1500
