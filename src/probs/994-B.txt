However, even such a knight will torment his conscience, so he can kill no more than $$$k$$$ other knights. Also, each knight has some number of coins. After a kill, a knight can pick up all victim's coins.Now each knight ponders: how many coins he can have if only he kills other knights?You should answer this question for each knight.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ $$$(1 \le n \le 10^5, 0 \le k \le \min(n-1,10))$$$ — the number of knights and the number $$$k$$$ from the statement.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2 ,\ldots,p_n$$$ $$$(1 \le p_i \le 10^9)$$$ — powers of the knights. All $$$p_i$$$ are distinct.The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2 ,\ldots,c_n$$$ $$$(0 \le c_i \le 10^9)$$$ — the number of coins each knight has.OutputPrint $$$n$$$ integers — the maximum number of coins each knight can have it only he kills other knights.     greedy      implementation      sortings      *1400
