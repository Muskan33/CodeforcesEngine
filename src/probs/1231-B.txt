B. Ania and Minimizingtime 1 secondmemory 256 Ania has a large integer $$$S$$$. Its decimal representation has length $$$n$$$ and doesn't contain any leading zeroes. Ania is allowed to change at most $$$k$$$ digits of $$$S$$$. She wants to do it in such a way that $$$S$$$ still won't contain any leading zeroes and it'll be minimal possible. What integer will Ania finish with?InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 200\,000$$$, $$$0 \leq k \leq n$$$) â€” the number of digits in the decimal representation of $$$S$$$ and the maximum allowed number of changed digits.The second line contains the integer $$$S$$$. It's guaranteed that $$$S$$$ has exactly $$$n$$$ digits and doesn't contain any leading zeroes.OutputOutput the minimal possible value of $$$S$$$ which Ania can end with. Note that the resulting integer should also have $$$n$$$ digits.     greedy      implementation      *1000
