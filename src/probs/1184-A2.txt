A2. Heidi Learns Hashing (Medium)time 2  256 After learning about polynomial hashing, Heidi decided to learn about shift-xor hashing. In particular, she came across this interesting problem.Given a bitstring $$$y \in \{0,1\}^n$$$ find out the number of different $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \leq k < n$$$) such that there exists $$$x \in \{0,1\}^n$$$ for which $$$y = x \oplus \mbox{shift}^k(x).$$$In the above, $$$\oplus$$$ is the xor operation and $$$\mbox{shift}^k$$$ is the operation of shifting a bitstring cyclically to the right $$$k$$$ times. For example, $$$001 \oplus 111 = 110$$$ and $$$\mbox{shift}^3(00010010111000) = 00000010010111$$$.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$), the length of the bitstring $$$y$$$.The second line contains the bitstring $$$y$$$.OutputOutput a single integer: the number of suitable values of $$$k$$$     brute force      number theory      *2100
