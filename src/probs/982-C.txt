C. Cut 'em all!time 1 secondmemory 256 You're given a tree with $$$n$$$ vertices.Your task is to determine the maximum possible number of edges that can be removed in such a way that all the remaining connected components will have even size.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$) denoting the size of the tree. The next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contain two integers $$$u$$$, $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le u, v \le n$$$) each, describing the vertices connected by the $$$i$$$-th edge.It's guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.OutputOutput a single integer $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of edges that can be removed to leave all connected components with even size, or $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible to remove edges in order to satisfy this property.     dfs and similar      dp      graphs      greedy      trees      *1500
