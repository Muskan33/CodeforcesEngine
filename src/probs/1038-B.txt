B. Non-Coprime Partitiontime 2  256 Find out if it is possible to partition the first $$$n$$$ positive integers into two non-empty disjoint sets $$$S_1$$$ and $$$S_2$$$ such that:$$$\mathrm{gcd}(\mathrm{sum}(S_1), \mathrm{sum}(S_2)) > 1$$$ Here $$$\mathrm{sum}(S)$$$ denotes the sum of all elements present in set $$$S$$$ and $$$\mathrm{gcd}$$$ means thegreatest common divisor.Every integer number from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ should be present in exactly one of $$$S_1$$$ or $$$S_2$$$.InputThe only line of the input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 45\,000$$$)OutputIf such partition doesn't exist, print "No" (quotes for clarity).Otherwise, print "Yes" (quotes for clarity), followed by two lines, describing $$$S_1$$$ and $$$S_2$$$ respectively.Each set description starts with the set size, followed by the elements of the set in any order. Each set must be non-empty.If there are multiple possible partitions — print any of them.     constructive algorithms      math      *1100
