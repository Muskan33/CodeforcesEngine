A. Ehab Fails to Be Thanostime 1 secondmemory 256 You're given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$2n$$$. Is it possible to reorder it in such way so that the sum of the first $$$n$$$ elements isn't equal to the sum of the last $$$n$$$ elements?InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 1000$$$), where $$$2n$$$ is the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line contains $$$2n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, $$$\ldots$$$, $$$a_{2n}$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^6$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.OutputIf there's no solution, print "-1" (without quotes). Otherwise, print a single line containing $$$2n$$$ space-separated integers. They must form a reordering of $$$a$$$. You are allowed to not change the order.     constructive algorithms      greedy      sortings      *1000
