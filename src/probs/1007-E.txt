E. Mini Metrotime 2  256 In a simplified version of a "Mini Metro" game, there is only one subway line, and all the trains go in the same direction. There are $$$n$$$ stations on the line, $$$a_i$$$ people are waiting for the train at the $$$i$$$-th station at the beginning of the game. The game starts at the beginning of the $$$0$$$-th hour. At the end of each hour (couple minutes before the end of the hour), $$$b_i$$$ people instantly arrive to the $$$i$$$-th station. If at some moment, the number of people at the $$$i$$$-th station is larger than $$$c_i$$$, you lose.A player has several trains which he can appoint to some hours. The capacity of each train is $$$k$$$ passengers. In the middle of the appointed hour, the train goes from the $$$1$$$-st to the $$$n$$$-th station, taking as many people at each station as it can accommodate. A train can not take people from the $$$i$$$-th station if there are people at the $$$i-1$$$-th station.If multiple trains are appointed to the same hour, their capacities are being added up and they are moving together.The player wants to stay in the game for $$$t$$$ hours. Determine the minimum number of trains he will need for it.InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$t$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq n, t \leq 200, 1 \leq k \leq 10^9$$$) — the number of stations on the line, hours we want to survive, and capacity of each train respectively.Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains three integers $$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$, and $$$c_i$$$ ($$$0 \leq a_i, b_i \leq c_i \leq 10^9$$$) — number of people at the $$$i$$$-th station in the beginning of the game, number of people arriving to $$$i$$$-th station in the end of each hour and maximum number of people at the $$$i$$$-th station allowed respectively.OutputOutput a single integer number — the answer to the problem.     dp      *3400
