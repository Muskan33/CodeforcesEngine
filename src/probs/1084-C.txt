C. The Fair Nut and Stringtime 1 secondmemory 256 The Fair Nut found a string $$$s$$$. The string consists of lowercase Latin letters. The Nut is a curious guy, so he wants to find the number of strictly increasing sequences $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k$$$, such that:   For each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \leq i \leq k$$$), $$$s_{p_i} =$$$ 'a'.  For each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \leq i < k$$$), there is such $$$j$$$ that $$$p_i < j < p_{i + 1}$$$ and $$$s_j =$$$ 'b'. The Nut is upset because he doesn't know how to find the number. Help him.This number should be calculated modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.InputThe first line contains the string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \leq |s| \leq 10^5$$$) consisting of lowercase Latin letters.OutputIn a single line print the answer to the problem — the number of such sequences $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k$$$ modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.     combinatorics      dp      implementation      *1500
