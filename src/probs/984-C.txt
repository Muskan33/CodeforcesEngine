C. Finite or not?time 1 secondmemory 256 You are given several queries. Each query consists of three integers $$$p$$$, $$$q$$$ and $$$b$$$. You need to answer whether the result of $$$p/q$$$ in notation with base $$$b$$$ is a finite fraction.A fraction in notation with base $$$b$$$ is finite if it contains finite number of numerals after the decimal point. It is also possible that a fraction has zero numerals after the decimal point.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the number of queries.Next $$$n$$$ lines contain queries, one per line. Each line contains three integers $$$p$$$, $$$q$$$, and $$$b$$$ ($$$0 \le p \le 10^{18}$$$, $$$1 \le q \le 10^{18}$$$, $$$2 \le b \le 10^{18}$$$). All numbers are given in notation with base $$$10$$$.OutputFor each question, in a separate line, print Finite if the fraction is finite and Infinite otherwise.     implementation      math      number theory      *1700
