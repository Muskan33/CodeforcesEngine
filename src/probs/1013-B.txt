B. Andtime 1 secondmemory 256 There is an array with n elements a1, a2, ..., an and the number x.In one operation you can select some i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) and replace element ai with ai & x, where & denotes the bitwise and operation.You want the array to have at least two equal elements after applying some operations (possibly, none). In other words, there should be at least two distinct indices i ≠ j such that ai = aj. Determine whether it is possible to achieve and, if possible, the minimal number of operations to apply.InputThe first line contains integers n and x (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ x ≤ 100 000), number of elements in the array and the number to and with.The second line contains n integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100 000), the elements of the array.OutputPrint a single integer denoting the minimal number of operations to do, or -1, if it is impossible.     greedy      *1200
