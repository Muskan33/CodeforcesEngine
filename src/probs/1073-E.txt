E. Segment Sumtime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$l \le r$$$). Your task is to calculate the sum of numbers from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ (including $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$) such that each number contains at most $$$k$$$ different digits, and print this sum modulo $$$998244353$$$.For example, if $$$k = 1$$$ then you have to calculate all numbers from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ such that each number is formed using only one digit. For $$$l = 10, r = 50$$$ the answer is $$$11 + 22 + 33 + 44 = 110$$$.InputThe only line of the input contains three integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}, 1 \le k \le 10$$$) — the borders of the segment and the maximum number of different digits.OutputPrint one integer — the sum of numbers from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ such that each number contains at most $$$k$$$ different digits, modulo $$$998244353$$$.     bitmasks      combinatorics      dp      math      *2300
