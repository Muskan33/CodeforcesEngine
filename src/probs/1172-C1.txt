C1. Nauuo and Pictures (easy version)time 4  256 The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints.Nauuo is a girl who loves random picture websites.One day she made a random picture website by herself which includes $$$n$$$ pictures.When Nauuo visits the website, she sees exactly one picture. The website does not display each picture with equal probability. The $$$i$$$-th picture has a non-negative weight $$$w_i$$$, and the probability of the $$$i$$$-th picture being displayed is $$$\frac{w_i}{\sum_{j=1}^nw_j}$$$. That is to say, the probability of a picture to be displayed is proportional to its weight.However, Nauuo discovered that some pictures she does not like were displayed too often. To solve this problem, she came up with a great idea: when she saw a picture she likes, she would add $$$1$$$ to its weight; otherwise, she would subtract $$$1$$$ from its weight.Nauuo will visit the website $$$m$$$ times. She wants to know the expected weight of each picture after all the $$$m$$$ visits modulo $$$998244353$$$. Can you help her?The expected weight of the $$$i$$$-th picture can be denoted by $$$\frac {q_i} {p_i}$$$ where $$$\gcd(p_i,q_i)=1$$$, you need to print an integer $$$r_i$$$ satisfying $$$0\le r_i<998244353$$$ and $$$r_i\cdot p_i\equiv q_i\pmod{998244353}$$$. It can be proved that such $$$r_i$$$ exists and is unique.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1\le n\le 50$$$, $$$1\le m\le 50$$$) — the number of pictures and the number of visits to the website.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$a_i$$$ is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$) — if $$$a_i=0$$$ , Nauuo does not like the $$$i$$$-th picture; otherwise Nauuo likes the $$$i$$$-th picture. It is guaranteed that there is at least one picture which Nauuo likes.The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$w_1,w_2,\ldots,w_n$$$ ($$$1\le w_i\le50$$$) — the initial weights of the pictures.OutputThe output contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_n$$$ — the expected weights modulo $$$998244353$$$.     dp      probabilities      *2300
