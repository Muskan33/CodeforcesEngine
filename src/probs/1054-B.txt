B. Appending Mextime 1 secondmemory 256 Initially Ildar has an empty array. He performs $$$n$$$ steps. On each step he takes a subset of integers already added to the array and appends the mex of this subset to the array. The mex of an multiset of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not presented in the multiset. For example, the mex of the multiset $$$[0, 2, 3]$$$ is $$$1$$$, while the mex of the multiset $$$[1, 2, 1]$$$ is $$$0$$$.More formally, on the step $$$m$$$, when Ildar already has an array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{m-1}$$$, he chooses some subset of indices $$$1 \leq i_1 < i_2 < \ldots < i_k < m$$$ (possibly, empty), where $$$0 \leq k < m$$$, and appends the $$$mex(a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \ldots a_{i_k})$$$ to the end of the array.After performing all the steps Ildar thinks that he might have made a mistake somewhere. He asks you to determine for a given array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ the minimum step $$$t$$$ such that he has definitely made a mistake on at least one of the steps $$$1, 2, \ldots, t$$$, or determine that he could have obtained this array without mistakes.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 100\,000$$$) — the number of steps Ildar made.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the array Ildar obtained.OutputIf Ildar could have chosen the subsets on each step in such a way that the resulting array is $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$, print $$$-1$$$.Otherwise print a single integer $$$t$$$ — the smallest index of a step such that a mistake was made on at least one step among steps $$$1, 2, \ldots, t$$$.     implementation      *1000
