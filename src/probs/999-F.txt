F. Cards and Joytime 2  256 There are $$$n$$$ players sitting at the card table. Each player has a favorite number. The favorite number of the $$$j$$$-th player is $$$f_j$$$.There are $$$k \cdot n$$$ cards on the table. Each card contains a single integer: the $$$i$$$-th card contains number $$$c_i$$$. Also, you are given a sequence $$$h_1, h_2, \dots, h_k$$$. Its meaning will be explained below.The players have to distribute all the cards in such a way that each of them will hold exactly $$$k$$$ cards. After all the cards are distributed, each player counts the number of cards he has that contains his favorite number. The joy level of a player equals $$$h_t$$$ if the player holds $$$t$$$ cards containing his favorite number. If a player gets no cards with his favorite number (i.e., $$$t=0$$$), his joy level is $$$0$$$.Print the maximum possible total joy levels of the players after the cards are distributed. Note that the sequence $$$h_1, \dots, h_k$$$ is the same for all the players.InputThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 500, 1 \le k \le 10$$$) — the number of players and the number of cards each player will get.The second line contains $$$k \cdot n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \dots, c_{k \cdot n}$$$ ($$$1 \le c_i \le 10^5$$$) — the numbers written on the cards.The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$f_1, f_2, \dots, f_n$$$ ($$$1 \le f_j \le 10^5$$$) — the favorite numbers of the players.The fourth line contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$h_1, h_2, \dots, h_k$$$ ($$$1 \le h_t \le 10^5$$$), where $$$h_t$$$ is the joy level of a player if he gets exactly $$$t$$$ cards with his favorite number written on them. It is guaranteed that the condition $$$h_{t - 1} < h_t$$$ holds for each $$$t \in [2..k]$$$.OutputPrint one integer — the maximum possible total joy levels of the players among all possible card distributions.     dp      *2000
