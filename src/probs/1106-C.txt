C. Lunar New Year and Number Divisiontime 2  256 Lunar New Year is approaching, and Bob is struggling with his homework â€“ a number division problem.There are $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ on Bob's homework paper, where $$$n$$$ is always an even number. Bob is asked to divide those numbers into groups, where each group must contain at least $$$2$$$ numbers. Suppose the numbers are divided into $$$m$$$ groups, and the sum of the numbers in the $$$j$$$-th group is $$$s_j$$$. Bob's aim is to minimize the sum of the square of $$$s_j$$$, that is $$$$$$\sum_{j = 1}^{m} s_j^2.$$$$$$Bob is puzzled by this hard problem. Could you please help him solve it?InputThe first line contains an even integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$$$), denoting that there are $$$n$$$ integers on Bob's homework paper.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^4$$$), describing the numbers you need to deal with.OutputA single line containing one integer, denoting the minimum of the sum of the square of $$$s_j$$$, which is $$$$$$\sum_{i = j}^{m} s_j^2,$$$$$$ where $$$m$$$ is the number of groups.     greedy      implementation      math      sortings      *900
