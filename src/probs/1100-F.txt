F. Ivan and Burgerstime 3  256 Ivan loves burgers and spending money. There are $$$n$$$ burger joints on the street where Ivan lives. Ivan has $$$q$$$ friends, and the $$$i$$$-th friend suggested to meet at the joint $$$l_i$$$ and walk to the joint $$$r_i$$$ $$$(l_i \leq r_i)$$$. While strolling with the $$$i$$$-th friend Ivan can visit all joints $$$x$$$ which satisfy $$$l_i \leq x \leq r_i$$$.For each joint Ivan knows the cost of the most expensive burger in it, it costs $$$c_i$$$ burles. Ivan wants to visit some subset of joints on his way, in each of them he will buy the most expensive burger and spend the most money. But there is a small issue: his card broke and instead of charging him for purchases, the amount of money on it changes as follows.If Ivan had $$$d$$$ burles before the purchase and he spent $$$c$$$ burles at the joint, then after the purchase he would have $$$d \oplus c$$$ burles, where $$$\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.Currently Ivan has $$$2^{2^{100}} - 1$$$ burles and he wants to go out for a walk. Help him to determine the maximal amount of burles he can spend if he goes for a walk with the friend $$$i$$$. The amount of burles he spends is defined as the difference between the initial amount on his account and the final account.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 500\,000$$$) — the number of burger shops.The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$$$ ($$$0 \leq c_i \leq 10^6$$$), where $$$c_i$$$ — the cost of the most expensive burger in the burger joint $$$i$$$.The third line contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \leq q \leq 500\,000$$$) — the number of Ivan's friends.Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contain two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq n$$$) — pairs of numbers of burger shops between which Ivan will walk. OutputOutput $$$q$$$ lines, $$$i$$$-th of which containing the maximum amount of money Ivan can spend with the friend $$$i$$$.     data structures      divide and conquer      greedy      math      *2500
