C. Ehab and a Special Coloring Problemtime 1 secondmemory 256 You're given an integer $$$n$$$. For every integer $$$i$$$ from $$$2$$$ to $$$n$$$, assign a positive integer $$$a_i$$$ such that the following conditions hold:  For any pair of integers $$$(i,j)$$$, if $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ are coprime, $$$a_i \neq a_j$$$.  The maximal value of all $$$a_i$$$ should be minimized (that is, as small as possible). A pair of integers is called coprime if their greatest common divisor is $$$1$$$.InputThe only line contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^5$$$).OutputPrint $$$n-1$$$ integers, $$$a_2$$$, $$$a_3$$$, $$$\ldots$$$, $$$a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq n$$$). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.     constructive algorithms      number theory      *1300
