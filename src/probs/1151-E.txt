E. Number of Componentstime 1 secondmemory 256 The Kingdom of Kremland is a tree (a connected undirected graph without cycles) consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices. Each vertex $$$i$$$ has its own value $$$a_i$$$. All vertices are connected in series by edges. Formally, for every $$$1 \leq i < n$$$ there is an edge between the vertices of $$$i$$$ and $$$i+1$$$.Denote the function $$$f(l, r)$$$, which takes two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$l \leq r$$$):    We leave in the tree only vertices whose values ​​range from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$.    The value of the function will be the number of connected components in the new graph. Your task is to calculate the following sum: $$$$$$\sum_{l=1}^{n} \sum_{r=l}^{n} f(l, r) $$$$$$InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq n$$$) — the values of the vertices.OutputPrint one number — the answer to the problem.     combinatorics      data structures      dp      math      *2100
