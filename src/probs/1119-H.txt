H. Tripletime 1.5  256 You have received your birthday gifts — $$$n$$$ triples of integers! The $$$i$$$-th of them is $$$\lbrace a_{i}, b_{i}, c_{i} \rbrace$$$. All numbers are greater than or equal to $$$0$$$, and strictly smaller than $$$2^{k}$$$, where $$$k$$$ is a fixed integer.One day, you felt tired playing with triples. So you came up with three new integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, $$$z$$$, and then formed $$$n$$$ arrays. The $$$i$$$-th array consists of $$$a_i$$$ repeated $$$x$$$ times, $$$b_i$$$ repeated $$$y$$$ times and $$$c_i$$$ repeated $$$z$$$ times. Thus, each array has length $$$(x + y + z)$$$.You want to choose exactly one integer from each array such that the XOR (bitwise exclusive or) of them is equal to $$$t$$$. Output the number of ways to choose the numbers for each $$$t$$$ between $$$0$$$ and $$$2^{k} - 1$$$, inclusive, modulo $$$998244353$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^{5}$$$, $$$1 \leq k \leq 17$$$) — the number of arrays and the binary length of all numbers.The second line contains three integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, $$$z$$$ ($$$0 \leq x,y,z \leq 10^{9}$$$) — the integers you chose.Then $$$n$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th of them contains three integers $$$a_{i}$$$, $$$b_{i}$$$ and $$$c_{i}$$$ ($$$0 \leq a_{i} , b_{i} , c_{i} \leq 2^{k} - 1$$$) — the integers forming the $$$i$$$-th array.OutputPrint a single line containing $$$2^{k}$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th of them should be the number of ways to choose exactly one integer from each array so that their XOR is equal to $$$t = i-1$$$ modulo $$$998244353$$$.     fft      math      *3200
