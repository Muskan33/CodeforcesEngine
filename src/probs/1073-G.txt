G. Yet Another LCP Problemtime 2  256 Let $$$\text{LCP}(s, t)$$$ be the length of the longest common prefix of strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$. Also let $$$s[x \dots y]$$$ be the substring of $$$s$$$ from index $$$x$$$ to index $$$y$$$ (inclusive). For example, if $$$s = $$$ "abcde", then $$$s[1 \dots 3] =$$$ "abc", $$$s[2 \dots 5] =$$$ "bcde".You are given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ queries. Each query is a pair of integer sets $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k$$$ and $$$b_1, b_2, \dots, b_l$$$. Calculate $$$\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{i = k} \sum\limits_{j = 1}^{j = l}{\text{LCP}(s[a_i \dots n], s[b_j \dots n])}$$$ for each query.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le n, q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of string $$$s$$$ and the number of queries, respectively.The second line contains a string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters ($$$|s| = n$$$).Next $$$3q$$$ lines contains descriptions of queries — three lines per query. The first line of each query contains two integers $$$k_i$$$ and $$$l_i$$$ ($$$1 \le k_i, l_i \le n$$$) — sizes of sets $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ respectively.The second line of each query contains $$$k_i$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots a_{k_i}$$$ ($$$1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_{k_i} \le n$$$) — set $$$a$$$.The third line of each query contains $$$l_i$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \dots b_{l_i}$$$ ($$$1 \le b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_{l_i} \le n$$$) — set $$$b$$$.It is guaranteed that $$$\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{i = q}{k_i} \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$ and $$$\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{i = q}{l_i} \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputPrint $$$q$$$ integers — answers for the queries in the same order queries are given in the input     data structures      string suffix structures      *2600
