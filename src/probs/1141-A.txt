A. Game 23time 1 secondmemory 256 Polycarp plays "Game 23". Initially he has a number $$$n$$$ and his goal is to transform it to $$$m$$$. In one move, he can multiply $$$n$$$ by $$$2$$$ or multiply $$$n$$$ by $$$3$$$. He can perform any number of moves.Print the number of moves needed to transform $$$n$$$ to $$$m$$$. Print -1 if it is impossible to do so.It is easy to prove that any way to transform $$$n$$$ to $$$m$$$ contains the same number of moves (i.e. number of moves doesn't depend on the way of transformation).InputThe only line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le m \le 5\cdot10^8$$$).OutputPrint the number of moves to transform $$$n$$$ to $$$m$$$, or -1 if there is no solution.     implementation      math      *1000
