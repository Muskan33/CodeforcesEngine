C. Less or Equaltime 2  256 You are given a sequence of integers of length $$$n$$$ and integer number $$$k$$$. You should print any integer number $$$x$$$ in the range of $$$[1; 10^9]$$$ (i.e. $$$1 \le x \le 10^9$$$) such that exactly $$$k$$$ elements of given sequence are less than or equal to $$$x$$$.Note that the sequence can contain equal elements.If there is no such $$$x$$$, print "-1" (without quotes).InputThe first line of the input contains integer numbers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \le k \le n$$$). The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integer numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) â€” the sequence itself.OutputPrint any integer number $$$x$$$ from range $$$[1; 10^9]$$$ such that exactly $$$k$$$ elements of given sequence is less or equal to $$$x$$$.If there is no such $$$x$$$, print "-1" (without quotes).     *special problem      sortings      *1200
