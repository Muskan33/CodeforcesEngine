B. Div Times Modtime 1 secondmemory 256 Vasya likes to solve equations. Today he wants to solve $$$(x~\mathrm{div}~k) \cdot (x \bmod k) = n$$$, where $$$\mathrm{div}$$$ and $$$\mathrm{mod}$$$ stand for integer division and modulo operations (refer to the Notes below for exact definition). In this equation, $$$k$$$ and $$$n$$$ are positive integer parameters, and $$$x$$$ is a positive integer unknown. If there are several solutions, Vasya wants to find the smallest possible $$$x$$$. Can you help him?InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^6$$$, $$$2 \leq k \leq 1000$$$).OutputPrint a single integer $$$x$$$ — the smallest positive integer solution to $$$(x~\mathrm{div}~k) \cdot (x \bmod k) = n$$$. It is guaranteed that this equation has at least one positive integer solution.     math      *1100
