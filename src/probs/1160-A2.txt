A2. Collaborationtime 15  768 Consider several locations in integer points on the plane. One of the locations is the base where workers wait. Every other location contains one job.Each job has the following characteristics: work duration, the required number of workers, and also the earliest possible moment of starting the job and the latest possible moment of completing it. In order to complete the job, the required number of workers must simultaneously start working on it, and then be continuously present at the location for the duration of the job. Each job must either be fully done exactly once, or left untouched.Our task is to determine what should the workers do so that we have more profit. any worker can contribute to any job. We can use as many workers as we like, but each worker must take part in doing at least one job.Each worker starts at the base at a certain moment, then moves between locations and does the jobs, and finally gets back to the base and stops completely. A worker can move along coordinate axes, and spends one minute increasing or decreasing any one of his coordinates by $$$1$$$. We have to pay the worker $$$240$$$ credits for appearing in our solution, and additionally $$$1$$$ credit per minute, up to the moment when the worker stops completely.We get rewarded for each job that is done. For a job with duration $$$d$$$ and the required number of workers $$$p$$$, we get a reward of $$$d \cdot p \cdot (p + 5)$$$ credits. The jobs which are not done don't contribute to this sum.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ from $$$500$$$ to $$$2000$$$: the number of locations. Each of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains six integers and describes one location in the format $$$x$$$ $$$y$$$ $$$d$$$ $$$p$$$ $$$l$$$ $$$h$$$. The coordinates $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ are integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$100$$$. The duration $$$d$$$ is an integer from $$$5$$$ to $$$30$$$ minutes. The required number of workers $$$p$$$ is an integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$7$$$ people. The earliest possible start moment $$$l$$$ and the latest possible completion moment $$$h$$$ are integers from $$$200$$$ to $$$800$$$ minutes, chosen so that $$$60 \le h - l \le 300$$$.The first location is the base. It is an exclusion to the rules above and has the format $$$x$$$ $$$y$$$ $$$0$$$ $$$0$$$ $$$0$$$ $$$0$$$. All given points $$$(x, y)$$$ are distinct.In all tests, the number $$$n$$$, as well as all points, durations, numbers of required workers, and time spans are chosen randomly, independently, and uniformly from the available choices.OutputPrint instructions for each worker as a block of a few lines which look as follows:  start (at-moment) (at-location)The first line of a block. Determines the moment when the worker starts at the base. The location must be the base, and so have the number $$$1$$$.  arrive (at-moment) (at-location)We want the worker to arrive at this moment to this location. If he can not make it in time after the previous command, the solution is considered incorrect. Locations are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in input order.  work (start-moment) (end-moment) (at-location)We want the worker to do the job at this location in this exact time interval. The location must be equal to the location in the previous arrival command. If the worker can not make it in time after the previous command, or the given time interval has wrong length or exceeds the time span of the location, the solution is considered incorrect. This command must be present at least once in each block. Recall that each job must be either completed simultaneously by the required number of workers, or left untouched, otherwise, the solution will be considered incorrect.  endThe last line of a block. The worker must be in the same position where he started. At each moment, there may be arbitrarily many workers in each location. All moments in the output must be integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$1000$$$, and all location numbers must be integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.Print consecutive blocks one under the other, with no gaps     *special problem
