C. Ayoub and Lost Arraytime 1 secondmemory 256 Ayoub had an array $$$a$$$ of integers of size $$$n$$$ and this array had two interesting properties:   All the integers in the array were between $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ (inclusive).  The sum of all the elements was divisible by $$$3$$$. Unfortunately, Ayoub has lost his array, but he remembers the size of the array $$$n$$$ and the numbers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, so he asked you to find the number of ways to restore the array. Since the answer could be very large, print it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$ (i.e. the remainder when dividing by $$$10^9 + 7$$$). In case there are no satisfying arrays (Ayoub has a wrong memory), print $$$0$$$.InputThe first and only line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le l \le r \le 10^9$$$) — the size of the lost array and the range of numbers in the array.OutputPrint the remainder when dividing by $$$10^9 + 7$$$ the number of ways to restore the array.     combinatorics      dp      math      *1500
