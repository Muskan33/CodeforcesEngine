F. Ж-functiontime 6  512 The length of the longest common prefix of two strings $$$s=s_1 s_2 \ldots s_n$$$ and $$$t = t_1 t_2 \ldots t_m$$$ is defined as the maximum $$$k \le \min(n, m)$$$ such that $$$s_1 s_2 \ldots s_k$$$ equals $$$t_1 t_2 \ldots t_k$$$. Let's denote the longest common prefix of two strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ as $$$lcp(s,t)$$$.Z-function of a string $$$s_1 s_2 \dots s_n$$$ is a sequence of integers $$$z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_n$$$, where $$$z_i = lcp(s_1 s_2 \ldots s_n,\ \ s_i s_{i+1} \dots s_n)$$$. Ж-function of a string $$$s$$$ is defined as $$$z_1 + z_2 + \ldots + z_n$$$.You're given a string $$$s=s_1 s_2 \ldots s_n$$$ and $$$q$$$ queries. Each query is described by two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$, where $$$1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$$$. The answer for the query is defined as Ж-function of the string $$$s_{l_i} s_{l_i +1} \ldots s_{r_i}$$$.InputThe first line contains the string $$$s$$$, consisting of lowercase English letters ($$$1 \leq |s| \leq 200\,000$$$). The second line contains one integer $$$q$$$ — the number of queries ($$$1 \leq q \leq 200\,000$$$). Each of the following $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$, describing the query ($$$1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq |s|$$$).OutputFor every query output one integer: the value of Ж-function of the corresponding substring.     string suffix structures      strings      *3500
