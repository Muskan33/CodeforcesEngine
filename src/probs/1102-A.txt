A. Integer Sequence Dividingtime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given an integer sequence $$$1, 2, \dots, n$$$. You have to divide it into two sets $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ in such a way that each element belongs to exactly one set and $$$|sum(A) - sum(B)|$$$ is minimum possible.The value $$$|x|$$$ is the absolute value of $$$x$$$ and $$$sum(S)$$$ is the sum of elements of the set $$$S$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^9$$$).OutputPrint one integer â€” the minimum possible value of $$$|sum(A) - sum(B)|$$$ if you divide the initial sequence $$$1, 2, \dots, n$$$ into two sets $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$.     math      *800
