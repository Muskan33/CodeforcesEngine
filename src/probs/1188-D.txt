D. Make Equaltime 4  256 You are given $$$n$$$ numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$. In one operation we can add to any one of those numbers a nonnegative integer power of $$$2$$$.What is the smallest number of operations we need to perform to make all $$$n$$$ numbers equal? It can be proved that under given constraints it doesn't exceed $$$10^{18}$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 10^{17}$$$).OutputOutput exactly one integer — the smallest number of operations we need to perform to make all $$$n$$$ numbers equal.     dp      *3100
