D. Ehab and another another xor problemtime 1 secondmemory 256 This is an interactive problem!Ehab plays a game with Laggy. Ehab has 2 hidden integers $$$(a,b)$$$. Laggy can ask a pair of integers $$$(c,d)$$$ and Ehab will reply with:  1 if $$$a \oplus c>b \oplus d$$$.  0 if $$$a \oplus c=b \oplus d$$$.  -1 if $$$a \oplus c<b \oplus d$$$. Operation $$$a \oplus b$$$ is the bitwise-xor operation of two numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.Laggy should guess $$$(a,b)$$$ with at most 62 questions. You'll play this game. You're Laggy and the interactor is Ehab.It's guaranteed that $$$0 \le a,b<2^{30}$$$.InputSee the interaction section.OutputTo print the answer, print "! a b" (without quotes). Don't forget to flush the output after printing the answer.InteractionTo ask a question, print "? c d" (without quotes). Both $$$c$$$ and $$$d$$$ must be non-negative integers less than $$$2^{30}$$$. Don't forget to flush the output after printing any question.After each question, you should read the answer as mentioned in the legend. If the interactor replies with -2, that means you asked more than 62 queries and your program should terminate.To flush the output, you can use:-  fflush(stdout) in C++.  System.out.flush() in Java.  stdout.flush() in Python.  flush(output) in Pascal.  See the documentation for other languages.
