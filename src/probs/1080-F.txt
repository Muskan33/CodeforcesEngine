F. Katya and Segments Setstime 3.5  512 It is a very important day for Katya. She has a test in a programming class. As always, she was given an interesting problem that she solved very fast. Can you solve that problem?You are given $$$n$$$ ordered segments sets. Each segment can be represented as a pair of two integers $$$[l, r]$$$ where $$$l\leq r$$$. Each set can contain an arbitrary number of segments (even $$$0$$$). It is possible that some segments are equal.You are also given $$$m$$$ queries, each of them can be represented as four numbers: $$$a, b, x, y$$$. For each segment, find out whether it is true that each set $$$p$$$ ($$$a\leq p\leq b$$$) contains at least one segment $$$[l, r]$$$ that lies entirely on the segment $$$[x, y]$$$, that is $$$x\leq l\leq r\leq y$$$. Find out the answer to each query.Note that you need to solve this problem online. That is, you will get a new query only after you print the answer for the previous query.InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ $$$(1\leq n,m\leq 10^5, 1\leq k\leq 3\cdot10^5)$$$ — the number of sets, queries, and segments respectively.Each of the next $$$k$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$, and $$$p$$$ $$$(1\leq l\leq r\leq 10^9, 1\leq p\leq n)$$$ — the limits of the segment and the index of a set, to which this segment belongs.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains four integers $$$a, b, x, y$$$ $$$(1\leq a\leq b\leq n, 1\leq x\leq y\leq 10^9)$$$ — the description of the query.OutputFor each query, print "yes" or "no" in a new line.InteractionAfter printing a query, do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use: fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; System.out.flush() in Java; flush(output) in Pascal; stdout.flush() in Python; see documentation for other languages     data structures      interactive      sortings      *2400
