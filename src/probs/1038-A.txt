A. Equalitytime 2  256 You are given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, which consists only of the first $$$k$$$ letters of the Latin alphabet. All letters in string $$$s$$$ are uppercase.A subsequence of string $$$s$$$ is a string that can be derived from $$$s$$$ by deleting some of its symbols without changing the order of the remaining symbols. For example, "ADE" and "BD" are subsequences of "ABCDE", but "DEA" is not.A subsequence of $$$s$$$ called good if the number of occurences of each of the first $$$k$$$ letters of the alphabet is the same.Find the length of the longest good subsequence of $$$s$$$. InputThe first line of the input contains integers $$$n$$$ ($$$1\le n \le 10^5$$$) and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le k \le 26$$$).The second line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. String $$$s$$$ only contains uppercase letters from 'A' to the $$$k$$$-th letter of Latin alphabet.OutputPrint the only integer — the length of the longest good subsequence of string $$$s$$$.     implementation      strings      *800
