E. Minimal Segment Covertime 2  256 You are given $$$n$$$ intervals in form $$$[l; r]$$$ on a number line.You are also given $$$m$$$ queries in form $$$[x; y]$$$. What is the minimal number of intervals you have to take so that every point (not necessarily integer) from $$$x$$$ to $$$y$$$ is covered by at least one of them? If you can't choose intervals so that every point from $$$x$$$ to $$$y$$$ is covered, then print -1 for that query.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of intervals and the number of queries, respectively.Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integer numbers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$0 \le l_i < r_i \le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the given intervals.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integer numbers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$0 \le x_i < y_i \le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the queries.OutputPrint $$$m$$$ integer numbers. The $$$i$$$-th number should be the answer to the $$$i$$$-th query: either the minimal number of intervals you have to take so that every point (not necessarily integer) from $$$x_i$$$ to $$$y_i$$$ is covered by at least one of them or -1 if you can't choose intervals so that every point from $$$x_i$$$ to $$$y_i$$$ is covered.     data structures      dfs and similar      divide and conquer      dp      greedy      implementation      trees      *2200
