E. Alternating Treetime 2  256 Given a tree with $$$n$$$ nodes numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Each node $$$i$$$ has an associated value $$$V_i$$$.If the simple path from $$$u_1$$$ to $$$u_m$$$ consists of $$$m$$$ nodes namely $$$u_1 \rightarrow u_2 \rightarrow u_3 \rightarrow \dots u_{m-1} \rightarrow u_{m}$$$, then its alternating function $$$A(u_{1},u_{m})$$$ is defined as $$$A(u_{1},u_{m}) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} (-1)^{i+1} \cdot V_{u_{i}}$$$. A path can also have $$$0$$$ edges, i.e. $$$u_{1}=u_{m}$$$.Compute the sum of alternating functions of all unique simple paths. Note that the paths are directed: two paths are considered different if the starting vertices differ or the ending vertices differ. The answer may be large so compute it modulo $$$10^{9}+7$$$. InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ $$$(2 \leq n \leq 2\cdot10^{5} )$$$ — the number of vertices in the tree.The second line contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_n$$$ ($$$-10^9\leq V_i \leq 10^9$$$) — values of the nodes.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contain two space-separated integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ $$$(1\leq u, v\leq n, u \neq v)$$$ denoting an edge between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.OutputPrint the total sum of alternating functions of all unique simple paths modulo $$$10^{9}+7$$$.      combinatorics      dfs and similar      divide and conquer      dp      probabilities      trees      *2300
