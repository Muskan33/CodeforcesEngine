B. Unnatural Conditionstime 1 secondmemory 256 Let $$$s(x)$$$ be sum of digits in decimal representation of positive integer $$$x$$$. Given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$, find some positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ such that   $$$s(a) \ge n$$$,  $$$s(b) \ge n$$$,  $$$s(a + b) \le m$$$. InputThe only line of input contain two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 1129$$$).OutputPrint two lines, one for decimal representation of $$$a$$$ and one for decimal representation of $$$b$$$. Both numbers must not contain leading zeros and must have length no more than $$$2230$$$.     constructive algorithms      math      *1200
