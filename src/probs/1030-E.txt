E. Vasya and Good Sequencestime 2  256 Vasya has a sequence $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$. Vasya may pefrom the following operation: choose some number from the sequence and swap any pair of bits in its binary representation. For example, Vasya can transform number $$$6$$$ $$$(\dots 00000000110_2)$$$ into $$$3$$$ $$$(\dots 00000000011_2)$$$, $$$12$$$ $$$(\dots 000000001100_2)$$$, $$$1026$$$ $$$(\dots 10000000010_2)$$$ and many others. Vasya can use this operation any (possibly zero) number of times on any number from the sequence.Vasya names a sequence as good one, if, using operation mentioned above, he can obtain the sequence with bitwise exclusive or of all elements equal to $$$0$$$.For the given sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ Vasya'd like to calculate number of integer pairs $$$(l, r)$$$ such that $$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$ and sequence $$$a_l, a_{l + 1}, \dots, a_r$$$ is good.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$) — length of the sequence.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^{18}$$$) — the sequence $$$a$$$.OutputPrint one integer — the number of pairs $$$(l, r)$$$ such that $$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$ and the sequence $$$a_l, a_{l + 1}, \dots, a_r$$$ is good.     bitmasks      dp      *2000
