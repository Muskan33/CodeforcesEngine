A. Ehab and another construction problemtime 1 secondmemory 256 Given an integer $$$x$$$, find 2 integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ such that:   $$$1 \le a,b \le x$$$  $$$b$$$ divides $$$a$$$ ($$$a$$$ is divisible by $$$b$$$).  $$$a \cdot b>x$$$.  $$$\frac{a}{b}<x$$$. InputThe only line contains the integer $$$x$$$ $$$(1 \le x \le 100)$$$.OutputYou should output two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, satisfying the given conditions, separated by a space. If no pair of integers satisfy the conditions above, print "-1" (without quotes).     brute force      constructive algorithms      *800
