B. Divisor Subtractiontime 2  256 You are given an integer number $$$n$$$. The following algorithm is applied to it:  if $$$n = 0$$$, then end algorithm;  find the smallest prime divisor $$$d$$$ of $$$n$$$;  subtract $$$d$$$ from $$$n$$$ and go to step $$$1$$$. Determine the number of subtrations the algorithm will make.InputThe only line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^{10}$$$).OutputPrint a single integer â€” the number of subtractions the algorithm will make.     implementation      math      number theory      *1200
