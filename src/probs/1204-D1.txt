D1. Kirk and a Binary String (easy version)time 1 secondmemory 256 The only difference between easy and hard versions is the length of the string. You can hack this problem only if you solve both problems.Kirk has a binary string $$$s$$$ (a string which consists of zeroes and ones) of length $$$n$$$ and he is asking you to find a binary string $$$t$$$ of the same length which satisfies the following conditions: For any $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$$$) the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the substring $$$s_{l}s_{l+1} \ldots s_{r}$$$ is equal to the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the substring $$$t_{l}t_{l+1} \ldots t_{r}$$$; The number of zeroes in $$$t$$$ is the maximum possible.A non-decreasing subsequence of a string $$$p$$$ is a sequence of indices $$$i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k$$$ such that $$$i_1 < i_2 < \ldots < i_k$$$ and $$$p_{i_1} \leq p_{i_2} \leq \ldots \leq p_{i_k}$$$. The length of the subsequence is $$$k$$$.If there are multiple substrings which satisfy the conditions, output any.InputThe first line contains a binary string of length not more than $$$2\: 000$$$.OutputOutput a binary string which satisfied the above conditions. If there are many such strings, output any of them.     brute force      greedy      strings      *2000
