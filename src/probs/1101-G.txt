G. (Zero XOR Subset)-lesstime 2  256 You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ of integer numbers.Your task is to divide the array into the maximum number of segments in such a way that:  each element is contained in exactly one segment;  each segment contains at least one element;  there doesn't exist a non-empty subset of segments such that bitwise XOR of the numbers from them is equal to $$$0$$$. Print the maximum number of segments the array can be divided into. Print -1 if no suitable division exists.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) â€” the size of the array.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$).OutputPrint the maximum number of segments the array can be divided into while following the given constraints. Print -1 if no suitable division exists.     math      matrices      *2300
