D. Good Tripletime 4  256 Toad Rash has a binary string $$$s$$$. A binary string consists only of zeros and ones.Let $$$n$$$ be the length of $$$s$$$.Rash needs to find the number of such pairs of integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ that $$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$$$ and there is at least one pair of integers $$$x$$$, $$$k$$$ such that $$$1 \leq x, k \leq n$$$, $$$l \leq x < x + 2k \leq r$$$, and $$$s_x = s_{x+k} = s_{x+2k}$$$.Find this number of pairs for Rash.InputThe first line contains the string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \leq |s| \leq 300\,000$$$), consisting of zeros and ones.OutputOutput one integer: the number of such pairs of integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ that $$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$$$ and there is at least one pair of integers $$$x$$$, $$$k$$$ such that $$$1 \leq x, k \leq n$$$, $$$l \leq x < x + 2k \leq r$$$, and $$$s_x = s_{x+k} = s_{x+2k}$$$.     brute force      *1900
