A. Mind the Gaptime 1 secondmemory 256 These days Arkady works as an air traffic controller at a large airport. He controls a runway which is usually used for landings only. Thus, he has a schedule of planes that are landing in the nearest future, each landing lasts $$$1$$$ minute.He was asked to insert one takeoff in the schedule. The takeoff takes $$$1$$$ minute itself, but for safety reasons there should be a time space between the takeoff and any landing of at least $$$s$$$ minutes from both sides.Find the earliest time when Arkady can insert the takeoff.InputThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$, $$$1 \le s \le 60$$$) — the number of landings on the schedule and the minimum allowed time (in minutes) between a landing and a takeoff.Each of next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$h$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$0 \le h \le 23$$$, $$$0 \le m \le 59$$$) — the time, in hours and minutes, when a plane will land, starting from current moment (i. e. the current time is $$$0$$$ $$$0$$$). These times are given in increasing order.OutputPrint two integers $$$h$$$ and $$$m$$$ — the hour and the minute from the current moment of the earliest time Arkady can insert the takeoff.     implementation      *1100
