H. Make Squaretime 7  1024 We call an array $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ good, if there exist two indices $$$i < j$$$ such that $$$b_i \cdot b_j$$$ is a perfect square.Given an array $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$, in one action you can perform one of the following:   multiply any element $$$b_i$$$ by any prime $$$p$$$;  divide any element $$$b_i$$$ by prime $$$p$$$, if $$$b_i$$$ is divisible by $$$p$$$. Let $$$f(b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m)$$$ be the minimum number of actions needed to make the array $$$b$$$ good.You are given an array of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ and $$$q$$$ queries of the form $$$l_i, r_i$$$. For each query output $$$f(a_{l_i}, a_{l_i + 1}, \ldots, a_{r_i})$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 194\,598$$$, $$$1 \le q \le 1\,049\,658$$$) — the length of the array and the number of queries.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 5\,032\,107$$$) — the elements of the array.Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \le l_i < r_i \le n$$$) — the parameters of a query.OutputOutput $$$q$$$ lines — the answers for each query in the order they are given in the input     math      *2900
