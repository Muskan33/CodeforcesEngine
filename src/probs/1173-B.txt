B. Nauuo and Chesstime 1 secondmemory 256 Nauuo is a girl who loves playing chess.One day she invented a game by herself which needs $$$n$$$ chess pieces to play on a $$$m\times m$$$ chessboard. The rows and columns are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. We denote a cell on the intersection of the $$$r$$$-th row and $$$c$$$-th column as $$$(r,c)$$$.The game's goal is to place $$$n$$$ chess pieces numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ on the chessboard, the $$$i$$$-th piece lies on $$$(r_i,\,c_i)$$$, while the following rule is satisfied: for all pairs of pieces $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$, $$$|r_i-r_j|+|c_i-c_j|\ge|i-j|$$$. Here $$$|x|$$$ means the absolute value of $$$x$$$.However, Nauuo discovered that sometimes she couldn't find a solution because the chessboard was too small.She wants to find the smallest chessboard on which she can put $$$n$$$ pieces according to the rules.She also wonders how to place the pieces on such a chessboard. Can you help her?InputThe only line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\le n\le 1000$$$) — the number of chess pieces for the game.OutputThe first line contains a single integer — the minimum value of $$$m$$$, where $$$m$$$ is the length of sides of the suitable chessboard.The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$r_i$$$ and $$$c_i$$$ ($$$1\le r_i,c_i\le m$$$) — the coordinates of the $$$i$$$-th chess piece.If there are multiple answers, print any.     constructive algorithms      greedy      *1100
