C. Make a Squaretime 2  256 You are given a positive integer $$$n$$$, written without leading zeroes (for example, the number 04 is incorrect). In one operation you can delete any digit of the given integer so that the result remains a positive integer without leading zeros.Determine the minimum number of operations that you need to consistently apply to the given integer $$$n$$$ to make from it the square of some positive integer or report that it is impossible.An integer $$$x$$$ is the square of some positive integer if and only if $$$x=y^2$$$ for some positive integer $$$y$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^{9}$$$). The number is given without leading zeroes.OutputIf it is impossible to make the square of some positive integer from $$$n$$$, print -1. In the other case, print the minimal number of operations required to do it.     brute force      implementation      math      *1400
