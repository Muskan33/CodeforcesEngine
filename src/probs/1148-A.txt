A. Another One Bites The Dusttime 1 secondmemory 256 Let's call a string good if and only if it consists of only two types of letters — 'a' and 'b' and every two consecutive letters are distinct. For example "baba" and "aba" are good strings and "abb" is a bad string.You have $$$a$$$ strings "a", $$$b$$$ strings "b" and $$$c$$$ strings "ab". You want to choose some subset of these strings and concatenate them in any arbitrarily order.What is the length of the longest good string you can obtain this way?InputThe first line contains three positive integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9$$$) — the number of strings "a", "b" and "ab" respectively.OutputPrint a single number — the maximum possible length of the good string you can obtain.     greedy      *800
