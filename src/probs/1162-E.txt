E. Thanos Nimtime 1 secondmemory 256 Alice and Bob are playing a game with $$$n$$$ piles of stones. It is guaranteed that $$$n$$$ is an even number. The $$$i$$$-th pile has $$$a_i$$$ stones.Alice and Bob will play a game alternating turns with Alice going first.On a player's turn, they must choose exactly $$$\frac{n}{2}$$$ nonempty piles and independently remove a positive number of stones from each of the chosen piles. They can remove a different number of stones from the piles in a single turn. The first player unable to make a move loses (when there are less than $$$\frac{n}{2}$$$ nonempty piles).Given the starting configuration, determine who will win the game.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 50$$$) — the number of piles. It is guaranteed that $$$n$$$ is an even number.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 50$$$) — the number of stones in the piles.OutputPrint a single string "Alice" if Alice wins; otherwise, print "Bob" (without double quotes).     games      *2000
