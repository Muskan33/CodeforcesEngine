A. 2-3-numberstime 1 secondmemory 256 A positive integer is called a 2-3-integer, if it is equal to 2x·3y for some non-negative integers x and y. In other words, these integers are such integers that only have 2 and 3 among their prime divisors. For example, integers 1, 6, 9, 16 and 108 — are 2-3 integers, while 5, 10, 21 and 120 are not.Print the number of 2-3-integers on the given segment [l, r], i. e. the number of sich 2-3-integers t that l ≤ t ≤ r.InputThe only line contains two integers l and r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 2·109).OutputPrint a single integer the number of 2-3-integers on the segment [l, r].     *1300
