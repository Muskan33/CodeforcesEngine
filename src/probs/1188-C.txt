C. Array Beautytime 5  256 Let's call beauty of an array $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$n > 1$$$)  — $$$\min\limits_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} |b_i - b_j|$$$.You're given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n$$$ and a number $$$k$$$. Calculate the sum of beauty over all subsequences of the array of length exactly $$$k$$$. As this number can be very large, output it modulo $$$998244353$$$.A sequence $$$a$$$ is a subsequence of an array $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.InputThe first line contains integers $$$n, k$$$ ($$$2 \le k \le n \le 1000$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 10^5$$$).OutputOutput one integer — the sum of beauty over all subsequences of the array of length exactly $$$k$$$. As this number can be very large, output it modulo $$$998244353$$$.     dp      *2500
