F. k-substringstime 4  256 You are given a string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.Let's denote k-substring of s as a string subsk = sksk + 1..sn + 1 - k. Obviously, subs1 = s, and there are exactly  such substrings.Let's call some string t an odd proper suprefix of a string T iff the following conditions are met: |T| > |t|;  |t| is an odd number;  t is simultaneously a prefix and a suffix of T.For evey k-substring () of s you have to calculate the maximum length of its odd proper suprefix.InputThe first line contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 106) — the length s.The second line contains the string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.OutputPrint  integers. i-th of them should be equal to maximum length of an odd proper suprefix of i-substring of s (or  - 1, if there is no such string that is an odd proper suprefix of i-substring).     binary search      hashing      string suffix structures      *2700
