D. Zero Quantity Maximizationtime 2  256 You are given two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, each contains $$$n$$$ integers.You want to create a new array $$$c$$$ as follows: choose some real (i.e. not necessarily integer) number $$$d$$$, and then for every $$$i \in [1, n]$$$ let $$$c_i := d \cdot a_i + b_i$$$.Your goal is to maximize the number of zeroes in array $$$c$$$. What is the largest possible answer, if you choose $$$d$$$ optimally?InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in both arrays.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$).The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1$$$, $$$b_2$$$, ..., $$$b_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le b_i \le 10^9$$$).OutputPrint one integer — the maximum number of zeroes in array $$$c$$$, if you choose $$$d$$$ optimally.     hashing      math      number theory      *1500
