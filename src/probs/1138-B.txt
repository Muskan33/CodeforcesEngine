B. Circustime 1 secondmemory 256 Polycarp is a head of a circus troupe. There are $$$n$$$ — an even number — artists in the troupe. It is known whether the $$$i$$$-th artist can perform as a clown (if yes, then $$$c_i = 1$$$, otherwise $$$c_i = 0$$$), and whether they can perform as an acrobat (if yes, then $$$a_i = 1$$$, otherwise $$$a_i = 0$$$).Split the artists into two performances in such a way that:   each artist plays in exactly one performance,  the number of artists in the two performances is equal (i.e. equal to $$$\frac{n}{2}$$$),  the number of artists that can perform as clowns in the first performance is the same as the number of artists that can perform as acrobats in the second performance. InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 5\,000$$$, $$$n$$$ is even) — the number of artists in the troupe.The second line contains $$$n$$$ digits $$$c_1 c_2 \ldots c_n$$$, the $$$i$$$-th of which is equal to $$$1$$$ if the $$$i$$$-th artist can perform as a clown, and $$$0$$$ otherwise.The third line contains $$$n$$$ digits $$$a_1 a_2 \ldots a_n$$$, the $$$i$$$-th of which is equal to $$$1$$$, if the $$$i$$$-th artist can perform as an acrobat, and $$$0$$$ otherwise.OutputPrint $$$\frac{n}{2}$$$ distinct integers — the indices of the artists that should play in the first performance.If there are multiple answers, print any.If there is no solution, print a single integer $$$-1$$$.     brute force      greedy      math      strings      *1800
