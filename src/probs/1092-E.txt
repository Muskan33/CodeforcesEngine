E. Minimal Diameter Foresttime 2  256 You are given a forest — an undirected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices such that each its connected component is a tree.The diameter (aka "longest shortest path") of a connected undirected graph is the maximum number of edges in the shortest path between any pair of its vertices.You task is to add some edges (possibly zero) to the graph so that it becomes a tree and the diameter of the tree is minimal possible.If there are multiple correct answers, print any of them.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 1000$$$, $$$0 \le m \le n - 1$$$) — the number of vertices of the graph and the number of edges, respectively.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$ ($$$1 \le v, u \le n$$$, $$$v \ne u$$$) — the descriptions of the edges.It is guaranteed that the given graph is a forest.OutputIn the first line print the diameter of the resulting tree.Each of the next $$$(n - 1) - m$$$ lines should contain two integers $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$ ($$$1 \le v, u \le n$$$, $$$v \ne u$$$) — the descriptions of the added edges.The resulting graph should be a tree and its diameter should be minimal possible.For $$$m = n - 1$$$ no edges are added, thus the output consists of a single integer — diameter of the given tree.If there are multiple correct answers, print any of them.     constructive algorithms      dfs and similar      greedy      trees      *2000
