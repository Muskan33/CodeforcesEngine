D. Slimetime 2  256 There are $$$n$$$ slimes in a row. Each slime has an integer value (possibly negative or zero) associated with it.Any slime can eat its adjacent slime (the closest slime to its left or to its right, assuming that this slime exists). When a slime with a value $$$x$$$ eats a slime with a value $$$y$$$, the eaten slime disappears, and the value of the remaining slime changes to $$$x - y$$$.The slimes will eat each other until there is only one slime left. Find the maximum possible value of the last slime.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 500\,000$$$) denoting the number of slimes.The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the value of $$$i$$$-th slime.OutputPrint an only integer — the maximum possible value of the last slime.     dp      greedy      implementation      *1800
