B. Equations of Mathematical Magictime 1 secondmemory 256 Colossal! — exclaimed Hawk-nose. — A programmer! That's exactly what we are looking for.Arkadi and Boris Strugatsky. Monday starts on SaturdayReading the book "Equations of Mathematical Magic" Roman Oira-Oira and Cristobal Junta found an interesting equation: $$$a - (a \oplus x) - x = 0$$$ for some given $$$a$$$, where $$$\oplus$$$ stands for a bitwise exclusive or (XOR) of two integers (this operation is denoted as ^ or xor in many modern programming languages). Oira-Oira quickly found some $$$x$$$, which is the solution of the equation, but Cristobal Junta decided that Oira-Oira's result is not interesting enough, so he asked his colleague how many non-negative solutions of this equation exist. This task turned out to be too difficult for Oira-Oira, so he asks you to help.InputEach test contains several possible values of $$$a$$$ and your task is to find the number of equation's solution for each of them. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of these values.The following $$$t$$$ lines contain the values of parameter $$$a$$$, each value is an integer from $$$0$$$ to $$$2^{30} - 1$$$ inclusive.OutputFor each value of $$$a$$$ print exactly one integer — the number of non-negative solutions of the equation for the given value of the parameter. Print answers in the same order as values of $$$a$$$ appear in the input.One can show that the number of solutions is always finite     math      *1200
