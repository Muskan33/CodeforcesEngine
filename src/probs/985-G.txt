G. Team Playerstime 2  256 There are $$$n$$$ players numbered from $$$0$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ with ranks. The $$$i$$$-th player has rank $$$i$$$.Players can form teams: the team should consist of three players and no pair of players in the team should have a conflict. The rank of the team is calculated using the following algorithm: let $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, $$$k$$$ be the ranks of players in the team and $$$i < j < k$$$, then the rank of the team is equal to $$$A \cdot i + B \cdot j + C \cdot k$$$.You are given information about the pairs of players who have a conflict. Calculate the total sum of ranks over all possible valid teams modulo $$$2^{64}$$$.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of players and the number of conflicting pairs.The second line contains three space-separated integers $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$ and $$$C$$$ ($$$1 \le A, B, C \le 10^6$$$) — coefficients for team rank calculation.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two space-separated integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$0 \le u_i, v_i < n, u_i \neq v_i$$$) — pair of conflicting players.It's guaranteed that each unordered pair of players appears in the input file no more than once.OutputPrint single integer — the total sum of ranks over all possible teams modulo $$$2^{64}$$$.     combinatorics      *2700
