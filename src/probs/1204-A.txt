A. BowWow and the Timetabletime 1 secondmemory 256 In the city of Saint Petersburg, a day lasts for $$$2^{100}$$$ minutes. From the main station of Saint Petersburg, a train departs after $$$1$$$ minute, $$$4$$$ minutes, $$$16$$$ minutes, and so on; in other words, the train departs at time $$$4^k$$$ for each integer $$$k \geq 0$$$. Team BowWow has arrived at the station at the time $$$s$$$ and it is trying to count how many trains have they missed; in other words, the number of trains that have departed strictly before time $$$s$$$. For example if $$$s = 20$$$, then they missed trains which have departed at $$$1$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$16$$$. As you are the only one who knows the time, help them!Note that the number $$$s$$$ will be given you in a binary representation without leading zeroes.InputThe first line contains a single binary number $$$s$$$ ($$$0 \leq s < 2^{100}$$$) without leading zeroes.OutputOutput a single number — the number of trains which have departed strictly before the time $$$s$$$.     math      *1000
