B. Mathtime 1 secondmemory 256 JATC's math teacher always gives the class some interesting math problems so that they don't get bored. Today the problem is as follows. Given an integer $$$n$$$, you can perform the following operations zero or more times:  mul $$$x$$$: multiplies $$$n$$$ by $$$x$$$ (where $$$x$$$ is an arbitrary positive integer).  sqrt: replaces $$$n$$$ with $$$\sqrt{n}$$$ (to apply this operation, $$$\sqrt{n}$$$ must be an integer). You can perform these operations as many times as you like. What is the minimum value of $$$n$$$, that can be achieved and what is the minimum number of operations, to achieve that minimum value?Apparently, no one in the class knows the answer to this problem, maybe you can help them?InputThe only line of the input contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^6$$$) — the initial number.OutputPrint two integers: the minimum integer $$$n$$$ that can be achieved using the described operations and the minimum number of operations required.     greedy      math      number theory      *1500
