A. Even Substringstime 0.5  256 You are given a string $$$s=s_1s_2\dots s_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$, which only contains digits $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$9$$$.A substring $$$s[l \dots r]$$$ of $$$s$$$ is a string $$$s_l s_{l + 1} s_{l + 2} \ldots s_r$$$. A substring $$$s[l \dots r]$$$ of $$$s$$$ is called even if the number represented by it is even. Find the number of even substrings of $$$s$$$. Note, that even if some substrings are equal as strings, but have different $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, they are counted as different substrings.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 65000$$$) — the length of the string $$$s$$$.The second line contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. The string $$$s$$$ consists only of digits $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$9$$$.OutputPrint the number of even substrings of $$$s$$$.     implementation      strings      *800
