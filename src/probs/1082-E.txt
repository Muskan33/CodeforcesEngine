E. Increasing Frequencytime 2  256 You are given array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You can choose one segment $$$[l, r]$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$) and integer value $$$k$$$ (positive, negative or even zero) and change $$$a_l, a_{l + 1}, \dots, a_r$$$ by $$$k$$$ each (i.e. $$$a_i := a_i + k$$$ for each $$$l \le i \le r$$$).What is the maximum possible number of elements with value $$$c$$$ that can be obtained after one such operation?InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \le c \le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of array and the value $$$c$$$ to obtain.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$) — array $$$a$$$.OutputPrint one integer — the maximum possible number of elements with value $$$c$$$ which can be obtained after performing operation described above.     binary search      dp      greedy      *2000
