D. Barcelonian Distancetime 1 secondmemory 256 In this problem we consider a very simplified model of Barcelona city.Barcelona can be represented as a plane with streets of kind $$$x = c$$$ and $$$y = c$$$ for every integer $$$c$$$ (that is, the rectangular grid). However, there is a detail which makes Barcelona different from Manhattan. There is an avenue called Avinguda Diagonal which can be represented as a the set of points $$$(x, y)$$$ for which $$$ax + by + c = 0$$$.One can walk along streets, including the avenue. You are given two integer points $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ somewhere in Barcelona. Find the minimal possible distance one needs to travel to get to $$$B$$$ from $$$A$$$.InputThe first line contains three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ ($$$-10^9\leq a, b, c\leq 10^9$$$, at least one of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ is not zero) representing the Diagonal Avenue.The next line contains four integers $$$x_1$$$, $$$y_1$$$, $$$x_2$$$ and $$$y_2$$$ ($$$-10^9\leq x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2\leq 10^9$$$) denoting the points $$$A = (x_1, y_1)$$$ and $$$B = (x_2, y_2)$$$.OutputFind the minimum possible travel distance between $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$. Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $$$10^{-6}$$$.Formally, let your answer be $$$a$$$, and the jury's answer be $$$b$$$. Your answer is accepted if and only if $$$\frac{|a - b|}{\max{(1, |b|)}} \le 10^{-6}$$$.     geometry      implementation      *1900
