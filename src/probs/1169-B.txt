B. Pairstime 2  256 Toad Ivan has $$$m$$$ pairs of integers, each integer is between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$, inclusive. The pairs are $$$(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \ldots, (a_m, b_m)$$$. He asks you to check if there exist two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \leq x < y \leq n$$$) such that in each given pair at least one integer is equal to $$$x$$$ or $$$y$$$.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 300\,000$$$, $$$1 \leq m \leq 300\,000$$$) — the upper bound on the values of integers in the pairs, and the number of given pairs.The next $$$m$$$ lines contain two integers each, the $$$i$$$-th of them contains two space-separated integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq n, a_i \neq b_i$$$) — the integers in the $$$i$$$-th pair.OutputOutput "YES" if there exist two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \leq x < y \leq n$$$) such that in each given pair at least one integer is equal to $$$x$$$ or $$$y$$$. Otherwise, print "NO". You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).     graphs      implementation      *1500
