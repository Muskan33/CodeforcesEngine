C. Greedy Arkadytime 1 secondmemory 256 $$$k$$$ people want to split $$$n$$$ candies between them. Each candy should be given to exactly one of them or be thrown away.The people are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$, and Arkady is the first of them. To split the candies, Arkady will choose an integer $$$x$$$ and then give the first $$$x$$$ candies to himself, the next $$$x$$$ candies to the second person, the next $$$x$$$ candies to the third person and so on in a cycle. The leftover (the remainder that is not divisible by $$$x$$$) will be thrown away.Arkady can't choose $$$x$$$ greater than $$$M$$$ as it is considered greedy. Also, he can't choose such a small $$$x$$$ that some person will receive candies more than $$$D$$$ times, as it is considered a slow splitting.Please find what is the maximum number of candies Arkady can receive by choosing some valid $$$x$$$.InputThe only line contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, $$$M$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^{18}$$$, $$$2 \le k \le n$$$, $$$1 \le M \le n$$$, $$$1 \le D \le \min{(n, 1000)}$$$, $$$M \cdot D \cdot k \ge n$$$) — the number of candies, the number of people, the maximum number of candies given to a person at once, the maximum number of times a person can receive candies.OutputPrint a single integer — the maximum possible number of candies Arkady can give to himself.Note that it is always possible to choose some valid $$$x$$$.     math      *2000
