A. Definite Gametime 1 secondmemory 256 Chouti was doing a competitive programming competition. However, after having all the problems accepted, he got bored and decided to invent some small games.He came up with the following game. The player has a positive integer $$$n$$$. Initially the value of $$$n$$$ equals to $$$v$$$ and the player is able to do the following operation as many times as the player want (possibly zero): choose a positive integer $$$x$$$ that $$$x<n$$$ and $$$x$$$ is not a divisor of $$$n$$$, then subtract $$$x$$$ from $$$n$$$. The goal of the player is to minimize the value of $$$n$$$ in the end.Soon, Chouti found the game trivial. Can you also beat the game?InputThe input contains only one integer in the first line: $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le v \le 10^9$$$), the initial value of $$$n$$$.OutputOutput a single integer, the minimum value of $$$n$$$ the player can get.     constructive algorithms      math      *800
