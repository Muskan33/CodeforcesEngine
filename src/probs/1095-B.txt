B. Array Stabilizationtime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integer numbers.Let instability of the array be the following value: $$$\max\limits_{i = 1}^{n} a_i - \min\limits_{i = 1}^{n} a_i$$$.You have to remove exactly one element from this array to minimize instability of the resulting $$$(n-1)$$$-elements array. Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.InputThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.OutputPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.     implementation      *900
