E. Number Clickertime 5  256 Allen is playing Number Clicker on his phone.He starts with an integer $$$u$$$ on the screen. Every second, he can press one of 3 buttons.  Turn $$$u \to u+1 \pmod{p}$$$.  Turn $$$u \to u+p-1 \pmod{p}$$$.  Turn $$$u \to u^{p-2} \pmod{p}$$$. Allen wants to press at most 200 buttons and end up with $$$v$$$ on the screen. Help him!InputThe first line of the input contains 3 positive integers: $$$u, v, p$$$ ($$$0 \le u, v \le p-1$$$, $$$3 \le p \le 10^9 + 9$$$). $$$p$$$ is guaranteed to be prime.OutputOn the first line, print a single integer $$$\ell$$$, the number of button presses. On the second line, print integers $$$c_1, \dots, c_\ell$$$, the button presses. For $$$1 \le i \le \ell$$$, $$$1 \le c_i \le 3$$$.We can show that the answer always exists.     divide and conquer      graphs      meet-in-the-middle      number theory      *2700
