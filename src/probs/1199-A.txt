A. City Daytime 1 secondmemory 256 For years, the Day of city N was held in the most rainy day of summer. New mayor decided to break this tradition and select a not-so-rainy day for the celebration. The mayor knows the weather forecast for the $$$n$$$ days of summer. On the $$$i$$$-th day, $$$a_i$$$ millimeters of rain will fall. All values $$$a_i$$$ are distinct.The mayor knows that citizens will watch the weather $$$x$$$ days before the celebration and $$$y$$$ days after. Because of that, he says that a day $$$d$$$ is not-so-rainy if $$$a_d$$$ is smaller than rain amounts at each of $$$x$$$ days before day $$$d$$$ and and each of $$$y$$$ days after day $$$d$$$. In other words, $$$a_d < a_j$$$ should hold for all $$$d - x \le j < d$$$ and $$$d < j \le d + y$$$. Citizens only watch the weather during summer, so we only consider such $$$j$$$ that $$$1 \le j \le n$$$.Help mayor find the earliest not-so-rainy day of summer.InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100\,000$$$, $$$0 \le x, y \le 7$$$) — the number of days in summer, the number of days citizens watch the weather before the celebration and the number of days they do that after.The second line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ denotes the rain amount on the $$$i$$$-th day.OutputPrint a single integer — the index of the earliest not-so-rainy day of summer. We can show that the answer always exists.     implementation      *1000
