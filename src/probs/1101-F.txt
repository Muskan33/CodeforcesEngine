F. Trucks and Citiestime 2  256 There are $$$n$$$ cities along the road, which can be represented as a straight line. The $$$i$$$-th city is situated at the distance of $$$a_i$$$ kilometers from the origin. All cities are situated in the same direction from the origin. There are $$$m$$$ trucks travelling from one city to another. Each truck can be described by $$$4$$$ integers: starting city $$$s_i$$$, finishing city $$$f_i$$$, fuel consumption $$$c_i$$$ and number of possible refuelings $$$r_i$$$. The $$$i$$$-th truck will spend $$$c_i$$$ litres of fuel per one kilometer. When a truck arrives in some city, it can be refueled (but refueling is impossible in the middle of nowhere). The $$$i$$$-th truck can be refueled at most $$$r_i$$$ times. Each refueling makes truck's gas-tank full. All trucks start with full gas-tank.All trucks will have gas-tanks of the same size $$$V$$$ litres. You should find minimum possible $$$V$$$ such that all trucks can reach their destinations without refueling more times than allowed.InputFirst line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 400$$$, $$$1 \le m \le 250000$$$) — the number of cities and trucks.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$, $$$a_i < a_{i+1}$$$) — positions of cities in the ascending order.Next $$$m$$$ lines contains $$$4$$$ integers each. The $$$i$$$-th line contains integers $$$s_i$$$, $$$f_i$$$, $$$c_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$ ($$$1 \le s_i < f_i \le n$$$, $$$1 \le c_i \le 10^9$$$, $$$0 \le r_i \le n$$$) — the description of the $$$i$$$-th truck.OutputPrint the only integer — minimum possible size of gas-tanks $$$V$$$ such that all trucks can reach their destinations     binary search      dp      *2400
