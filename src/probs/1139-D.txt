D. Steps to Onetime 2  256 Vivek initially has an empty array $$$a$$$ and some integer constant $$$m$$$.He performs the following algorithm:  Select a random integer $$$x$$$ uniformly in range from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ and append it to the end of $$$a$$$.  Compute the greatest common divisor of integers in $$$a$$$.  In case it equals to $$$1$$$, break  Otherwise, return to step $$$1$$$. Find the expected length of $$$a$$$. It can be shown that it can be represented as $$$\frac{P}{Q}$$$ where $$$P$$$ and $$$Q$$$ are coprime integers and $$$Q\neq 0 \pmod{10^9+7}$$$. Print the value of $$$P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{10^9+7}$$$.InputThe first and only line contains a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq m \leq 100000$$$).OutputPrint a single integer — the expected length of the array $$$a$$$ written as $$$P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{10^9+7}$$$.     dp      math      number theory      probabilities      *2300
