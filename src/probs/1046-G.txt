G. Space Isaactime 1.5  256 Everybody seems to think that the Martians are green, but it turns out they are metallic pink and fat. Ajs has two bags of distinct nonnegative integers. The bags are disjoint, and the union of the sets of numbers in the bags is $$$\{0,1,â€¦,M-1\}$$$, for some positive integer $$$M$$$. Ajs draws a number from the first bag and a number from the second bag, and then sums them modulo $$$M$$$.What are the residues modulo $$$M$$$ that Ajs cannot obtain with this action?InputThe first line contains two positive integer $$$N$$$ ($$$1 \leq N \leq 200\,000$$$) and $$$M$$$ ($$$N+1 \leq M \leq 10^{9}$$$), denoting the number of the elements in the first bag and the modulus, respectively.The second line contains $$$N$$$ nonnegative integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_N$$$ ($$$0 \leq a_1<a_2< \ldots< a_N<M$$$), the contents of the first bag. OutputIn the first line, output the cardinality $$$K$$$ of the set of residues modulo $$$M$$$ which Ajs cannot obtain.In the second line of the output, print $$$K$$$ space-separated integers greater or equal than zero and less than $$$M$$$, which represent the residues Ajs cannot obtain. The outputs should be sorted in increasing order of magnitude. If $$$K$$$=0, do not output the second line.     *2400
