G. X-mouse in the Campustime 1.5  256 The campus has $$$m$$$ rooms numbered from $$$0$$$ to $$$m - 1$$$. Also the $$$x$$$-mouse lives in the campus. The $$$x$$$-mouse is not just a mouse: each second $$$x$$$-mouse moves from room $$$i$$$ to the room $$$i \cdot x \mod{m}$$$ (in fact, it teleports from one room to another since it doesn't visit any intermediate room). Starting position of the $$$x$$$-mouse is unknown.You are responsible to catch the $$$x$$$-mouse in the campus, so you are guessing about minimum possible number of traps (one trap in one room) you need to place. You are sure that if the $$$x$$$-mouse enters a trapped room, it immediately gets caught.And the only observation you made is $$$\text{GCD} (x, m) = 1$$$.InputThe only line contains two integers $$$m$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$2 \le m \le 10^{14}$$$, $$$1 \le x < m$$$, $$$\text{GCD} (x, m) = 1$$$) — the number of rooms and the parameter of $$$x$$$-mouse. OutputPrint the only integer — minimum number of traps you need to install to catch the $$$x$$$-mouse.     bitmasks      math      number theory      *2600
