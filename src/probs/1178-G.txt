G. The Awesomest Vertextime 5  256 You are given a rooted tree on $$$n$$$ vertices. The vertices are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$; the root is the vertex number $$$1$$$.Each vertex has two integers associated with it: $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$. We denote the set of all ancestors of $$$v$$$ (including $$$v$$$ itself) by $$$R(v)$$$. The awesomeness of a vertex $$$v$$$ is defined as $$$$$$\left| \sum_{w \in R(v)} a_w\right| \cdot \left|\sum_{w \in R(v)} b_w\right|,$$$$$$where $$$|x|$$$ denotes the absolute value of $$$x$$$. Process $$$q$$$ queries of one of the following forms:   1 v x — increase $$$a_v$$$ by a positive integer $$$x$$$.  2 v — report the maximum awesomeness in the subtree of vertex $$$v$$$. InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2\cdot 10^5, 1 \leq q \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of queries, respectively.The second line contains $$$n - 1$$$ integers $$$p_2, p_3, \dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq p_i < i$$$), where $$$p_i$$$ means that there is an edge between vertices $$$i$$$ and $$$p_i$$$.The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$-5000 \leq a_i \leq 5000$$$), the initial values of $$$a_i$$$ for each vertex.The fourth line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$$$ ($$$-5000 \leq b_i \leq 5000$$$), the values of $$$b_i$$$ for each vertex.Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines describes a query. It has one of the following forms:   1 v x  ($$$1 \leq v \leq n$$$, $$$1\leq x \leq 5000$$$).  2 v  ($$$1 \leq v \leq n$$$). OutputFor each query of the second type, print a single line with the maximum awesomeness in the respective subtree     data structures      dfs and similar      *3000
