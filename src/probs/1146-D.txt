D. Frog Jumpingtime 2  256 A frog is initially at position $$$0$$$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.InputThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$$$).OutputPrint a single integer, the desired sum.     dfs and similar      math      number theory      *2100
