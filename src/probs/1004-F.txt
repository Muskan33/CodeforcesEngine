F. Sonya and Bitwise ORtime 4  512 Sonya has an array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers and also one non-negative integer $$$x$$$. She has to perform $$$m$$$ queries of two types:  $$$1$$$ $$$i$$$ $$$y$$$: replace $$$i$$$-th element by value $$$y$$$, i.e. to perform an operation $$$a_{i}$$$ := $$$y$$$;  $$$2$$$ $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$: find the number of pairs ($$$L$$$, $$$R$$$) that $$$l\leq L\leq R\leq r$$$ and bitwise OR of all integers in the range $$$[L, R]$$$ is at least $$$x$$$ (note that $$$x$$$ is a constant for all queries). Can you help Sonya perform all her queries?Bitwise OR is a binary operation on a pair of non-negative integers. To calculate the bitwise OR of two numbers, you need to write both numbers in binary notation. The result is a number, in binary, which contains a one in each digit if there is a one in the binary notation of at least one of the two numbers. For example, $$$10$$$ OR $$$19$$$ = $$$1010_2$$$ OR $$$10011_2$$$ = $$$11011_2$$$ = $$$27$$$.InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$x$$$ ($$$1\leq n, m\leq 10^5$$$, $$$0\leq x<2^{20}$$$) — the number of numbers, the number of queries, and the constant for all queries.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0\leq a_i<2^{20}$$$) — numbers of the array.The following $$$m$$$ lines each describe an query. A line has one of the following formats:  $$$1$$$ $$$i$$$ $$$y$$$ ($$$1\leq i\leq n$$$, $$$0\leq y<2^{20}$$$), meaning that you have to replace $$$a_{i}$$$ by $$$y$$$;  $$$2$$$ $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$ ($$$1\leq l\leq r\leq n$$$), meaning that you have to find the number of subarrays on the segment from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ that the bitwise OR of all numbers there is at least $$$x$$$. OutputFor each query of type 2, print the number of subarrays such that the bitwise OR of all the numbers in the range is at least $$$x$$$.     bitmasks      data structures      divide and conquer      *2600
