D. Concatenated Multiplestime 2  256 You are given an array $$$a$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ positive integers.Let's call a concatenation of numbers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ the number that is obtained by writing down numbers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ one right after another without changing the order. For example, a concatenation of numbers $$$12$$$ and $$$3456$$$ is a number $$$123456$$$.Count the number of ordered pairs of positions $$$(i, j)$$$ ($$$i \neq j$$$) in array $$$a$$$ such that the concatenation of $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ is divisible by $$$k$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$2 \le k \le 10^9$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$).OutputPrint a single integer â€” the number of ordered pairs of positions $$$(i, j)$$$ ($$$i \neq j$$$) in array $$$a$$$ such that the concatenation of $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ is divisible by $$$k$$$.     implementation      math      *1900
