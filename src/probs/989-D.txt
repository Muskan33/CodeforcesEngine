D. A Shade of Moonlighttime 2  256  Gathering darkness shrouds the woods and the world. The moon sheds its light on the boat and the river."To curtain off the moonlight should be hardly possible; the shades present its mellow beauty and restful nature." Intonates Mino."See? The clouds are coming." Kanno gazes into the distance."That can't be better," Mino turns to Kanno. The sky can be seen as a one-dimensional axis. The moon is at the origin whose coordinate is $$$0$$$.There are $$$n$$$ clouds floating in the sky. Each cloud has the same length $$$l$$$. The $$$i$$$-th initially covers the range of $$$(x_i, x_i + l)$$$ (endpoints excluded). Initially, it moves at a velocity of $$$v_i$$$, which equals either $$$1$$$ or $$$-1$$$.Furthermore, no pair of clouds intersect initially, that is, for all $$$1 \leq i \lt j \leq n$$$, $$$\lvert x_i - x_j \rvert \geq l$$$.With a wind velocity of $$$w$$$, the velocity of the $$$i$$$-th cloud becomes $$$v_i + w$$$. That is, its coordinate increases by $$$v_i + w$$$ during each unit of time. Note that the wind can be strong and clouds can change their direction.You are to help Mino count the number of pairs $$$(i, j)$$$ ($$$i < j$$$), such that with a proper choice of wind velocity $$$w$$$ not exceeding $$$w_\mathrm{max}$$$ in absolute value (possibly negative and/or fractional), the $$$i$$$-th and $$$j$$$-th clouds both cover the moon at the same future moment. This $$$w$$$ doesn't need to be the same across different pairs.InputThe first line contains three space-separated integers $$$n$$$, $$$l$$$, and $$$w_\mathrm{max}$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$, $$$1 \leq l, w_\mathrm{max} \leq 10^8$$$) — the number of clouds, the length of each cloud and the maximum wind speed, respectively.The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains two space-separated integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$-10^8 \leq x_i \leq 10^8$$$, $$$v_i \in \{-1, 1\}$$$) — the initial position and the velocity of the $$$i$$$-th cloud, respectively.The input guarantees that for all $$$1 \leq i \lt j \leq n$$$, $$$\lvert x_i - x_j \rvert \geq l$$$.OutputOutput one integer — the number of unordered pairs of clouds such that it's possible that clouds from each pair cover the moon at the same future moment with a proper choice of wind velocity $$$w$$$.     binary search      geometry      math      sortings      two pointers      *2500
