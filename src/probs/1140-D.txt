D. Minimum Triangulationtime 2  256 You are given a regular polygon with $$$n$$$ vertices labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in counter-clockwise order. The triangulation of a given polygon is a set of triangles such that each vertex of each triangle is a vertex of the initial polygon, there is no pair of triangles such that their intersection has non-zero area, and the total area of all triangles is equal to the area of the given polygon. The weight of a triangulation is the sum of weigths of triangles it consists of, where the weight of a triagle is denoted as the product of labels of its vertices.Calculate the minimum weight among all triangulations of the polygon.InputThe first line contains single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 500$$$) — the number of vertices in the regular polygon.OutputPrint one integer — the minimum weight among all triangulations of the given polygon.     dp      greedy      math      *1200
