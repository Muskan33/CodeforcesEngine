B. Filling the Gridtime 1 secondmemory 256 Suppose there is a $$$h \times w$$$ grid consisting of empty or full cells. Let's make some definitions:  $$$r_{i}$$$ is the number of consecutive full cells connected to the left side in the $$$i$$$-th row ($$$1 \le i \le h$$$). In particular, $$$r_i=0$$$ if the leftmost cell of the $$$i$$$-th row is empty.  $$$c_{j}$$$ is the number of consecutive full cells connected to the top end in the $$$j$$$-th column ($$$1 \le j \le w$$$). In particular, $$$c_j=0$$$ if the topmost cell of the $$$j$$$-th column is empty. In other words, the $$$i$$$-th row starts exactly with $$$r_i$$$ full cells. Similarly, the $$$j$$$-th column starts exactly with $$$c_j$$$ full cells.  These are the $$$r$$$ and $$$c$$$ values of some $$$3 \times 4$$$ grid. Black cells are full and white cells are empty. You have values of $$$r$$$ and $$$c$$$. Initially, all cells are empty. Find the number of ways to fill grid cells to satisfy values of $$$r$$$ and $$$c$$$. Since the answer can be very large, find the answer modulo $$$1000000007\,(10^{9} + 7)$$$. In other words, find the remainder after division of the answer by $$$1000000007\,(10^{9} + 7)$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$h$$$ and $$$w$$$ ($$$1 \le h, w \le 10^{3}$$$) — the height and width of the grid.The second line contains $$$h$$$ integers $$$r_{1}, r_{2}, \ldots, r_{h}$$$ ($$$0 \le r_{i} \le w$$$) — the values of $$$r$$$.The third line contains $$$w$$$ integers $$$c_{1}, c_{2}, \ldots, c_{w}$$$ ($$$0 \le c_{j} \le h$$$) — the values of $$$c$$$.OutputPrint the answer modulo $$$1000000007\,(10^{9} + 7)$$$.     implementation      math      *1400
