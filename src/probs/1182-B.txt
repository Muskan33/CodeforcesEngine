B. Plus from Picturetime 1 secondmemory 256 You have a given picture with size $$$w \times h$$$. Determine if the given picture has a single "+" shape or not. A "+" shape is described below:  A "+" shape has one center nonempty cell.  There should be some (at least one) consecutive non-empty cells in each direction (left, right, up, down) from the center. In other words, there should be a ray in each direction.  All other cells are empty. Find out if the given picture has single "+" shape.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$h$$$ and $$$w$$$ ($$$1 \le h$$$, $$$w \le 500$$$) — the height and width of the picture.The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$h$$$ lines contains string $$$s_{i}$$$ of length $$$w$$$ consisting "." and "*" where "." denotes the empty space and "*" denotes the non-empty space.OutputIf the given picture satisfies all conditions, print "YES". Otherwise, print "NO".You can output each letter in any case (upper or lower).     dfs and similar      implementation      strings      *1300
