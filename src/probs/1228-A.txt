A. Distinct Digitstime 1 secondmemory 256 You have two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$. Find an integer $$$x$$$ which satisfies the conditions below:  $$$l \le x \le r$$$.  All digits of $$$x$$$ are different. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le 10^{5}$$$).OutputIf an answer exists, print any of them. Otherwise, print $$$-1$$$.     brute force      implementation      *800
