G. Zoning Restrictionstime 1 secondmemory 256 You are planning to build housing on a street. There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you can gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions though. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that if the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ is strictly more than $$$x_i$$$, you must pay a fine of $$$c_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit (sum of dollars gained minus fines). Determine the maximum profit possible.InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n,h,m$$$ ($$$1 \leq n,h,m \leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions, respectively.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains four integers $$$l_i, r_i, x_i, c_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq n$$$, $$$0 \leq x_i \leq h$$$, $$$1 \leq c_i \leq 5\,000$$$).OutputPrint a single integer denoting the maximum profit you can make.     dp      flows      graphs      *2700
