D. Makoto and a Blackboardtime 2  256 Makoto has a big blackboard with a positive integer $$$n$$$ written on it. He will perform the following action exactly $$$k$$$ times:Suppose the number currently written on the blackboard is $$$v$$$. He will randomly pick one of the divisors of $$$v$$$ (possibly $$$1$$$ and $$$v$$$) and replace $$$v$$$ with this divisor. As Makoto uses his famous random number generator (RNG) and as he always uses $$$58$$$ as his generator seed, each divisor is guaranteed to be chosen with equal probability.He now wonders what is the expected value of the number written on the blackboard after $$$k$$$ steps.It can be shown that this value can be represented as $$$\frac{P}{Q}$$$ where $$$P$$$ and $$$Q$$$ are coprime integers and $$$Q \not\equiv 0 \pmod{10^9+7}$$$. Print the value of $$$P \cdot Q^{-1}$$$ modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.InputThe only line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^{15}$$$, $$$1 \leq k \leq 10^4$$$).OutputPrint a single integer â€” the expected value of the number on the blackboard after $$$k$$$ steps as $$$P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{10^9+7}$$$ for $$$P$$$, $$$Q$$$ defined above.     dp      math      number theory      probabilities      *2200
