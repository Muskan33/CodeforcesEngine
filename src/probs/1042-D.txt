D. Petya and Arraytime 2  256 Petya has an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. He has learned partial sums recently, and now he can calculate the sum of elements on any segment of the array really fast. The segment is a non-empty sequence of elements standing one next to another in the array.Now he wonders what is the number of segments in his array with the sum less than $$$t$$$. Help Petya to calculate this number.More formally, you are required to calculate the number of pairs $$$l, r$$$ ($$$l \le r$$$) such that $$$a_l + a_{l+1} + \dots + a_{r-1} + a_r < t$$$.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 200\,000, |t| \le 2\cdot10^{14}$$$).The second line contains a sequence of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$|a_{i}| \le 10^{9}$$$) â€” the description of Petya's array. Note that there might be negative, zero and positive elements.OutputPrint the number of segments in Petya's array with the sum of elements less than $$$t$$$.     data structures      divide and conquer      two pointers      *1800
