E. Expected Value Againtime 4  256 You are given integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$. Let's consider the alphabet consisting of $$$k$$$ different elements.Let beauty $$$f(s)$$$ of the string $$$s$$$ be the number of indexes $$$i$$$, $$$1\le i<|s|$$$, for which prefix of $$$s$$$ of length $$$i$$$ equals to suffix of $$$s$$$ of length $$$i$$$. For example, beauty of the string $$$abacaba$$$ equals $$$2$$$, as for $$$i = 1, 3$$$ prefix and suffix of length $$$i$$$ are equal.Consider all words of length $$$n$$$ in the given alphabet. Find the expected value of $$$f(s)^2$$$ of a uniformly chosen at random word. We can show that it can be expressed as $$$\frac{P}{Q}$$$, where $$$P$$$ and $$$Q$$$ are coprime and $$$Q$$$ isn't divided by $$$10^9 + 7$$$. Output $$$P\cdot Q^{-1} \bmod 10^9 + 7$$$.InputThe first and the only line contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1\le n \le 10^5$$$, $$$1\le k\le 10^9$$$) — the length of a string and the size of alphabet respectively.OutputOutput a single integer — $$$P\times Q^{-1} \bmod 10^9 + 7$$$.     combinatorics      strings      *3100
