F. Tokitsukaze and Powerstime 3  256 Tokitsukaze is playing a room escape game designed by SkywalkerT. In this game, she needs to find out hidden clues in the room to reveal a way to escape.After a while, she realizes that the only way to run away is to open the digital door lock since she accidentally went into a secret compartment and found some clues, which can be interpreted as:  Only when you enter $$$n$$$ possible different passwords can you open the door;  Passwords must be integers ranged from $$$0$$$ to $$$(m - 1)$$$;  A password cannot be $$$x$$$ ($$$0 \leq x < m$$$) if $$$x$$$ and $$$m$$$ are not coprime (i.e. $$$x$$$ and $$$m$$$ have some common divisor greater than $$$1$$$);  A password cannot be $$$x$$$ ($$$0 \leq x < m$$$) if there exist non-negative integers $$$e$$$ and $$$k$$$ such that $$$p^e = k m + x$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a secret integer;  Any integer that doesn't break the above rules can be a password;  Several integers are hidden in the room, but only one of them can be $$$p$$$. Fortunately, she finds that $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ are recorded in the lock. However, what makes Tokitsukaze frustrated is that she doesn't do well in math. Now that she has found an integer that is suspected to be $$$p$$$, she wants you to help her find out $$$n$$$ possible passwords, or determine the integer cannot be $$$p$$$.InputThe only line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$p$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 5 \times 10^5$$$, $$$1 \leq p < m \leq 10^{18}$$$).It is guaranteed that $$$m$$$ is a positive integer power of a single prime number.OutputIf the number of possible different passwords is less than $$$n$$$, print a single integer $$$-1$$$.Otherwise, print $$$n$$$ distinct integers ranged from $$$0$$$ to $$$(m - 1)$$$ as passwords. You can print these integers in any order. Besides, if there are multiple solutions, print any.     number theory      probabilities      *3400
