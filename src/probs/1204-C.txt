C. Anna, Svyatoslav and Mapstime 2  256 The main characters have been omitted to be short.You are given a directed unweighted graph without loops with $$$n$$$ vertexes and a path in it (that path is not necessary simple) given by a sequence $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m$$$ of $$$m$$$ vertexes; for each $$$1 \leq i < m$$$ there is an arc from $$$p_i$$$ to $$$p_{i+1}$$$.Define the sequence $$$v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k$$$ of $$$k$$$ vertexes as good, if $$$v$$$ is a subsequence of $$$p$$$, $$$v_1 = p_1$$$, $$$v_k = p_m$$$, and $$$p$$$ is one of the shortest paths passing through the vertexes $$$v_1$$$, $$$\ldots$$$, $$$v_k$$$ in that order.A sequence $$$a$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. It is obvious that the sequence $$$p$$$ is good but your task is to find the shortest good subsequence.If there are multiple shortest good subsequences, output any of them. InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 100$$$) — the number of vertexes in a graph. The next $$$n$$$ lines define the graph by an adjacency matrix: the $$$j$$$-th character in the $$$i$$$-st line is equal to $$$1$$$ if there is an arc from vertex $$$i$$$ to the vertex $$$j$$$ else it is equal to $$$0$$$. It is guaranteed that the graph doesn't contain loops.The next line contains a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \le m \le 10^6$$$) — the number of vertexes in the path. The next line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m$$$ ($$$1 \le p_i \le n$$$) — the sequence of vertexes in the path. It is guaranteed that for any $$$1 \leq i < m$$$ there is an arc from $$$p_i$$$ to $$$p_{i+1}$$$.OutputIn the first line output a single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \leq k \leq m$$$) — the length of the shortest good subsequence. In the second line output $$$k$$$ integers $$$v_1$$$, $$$\ldots$$$, $$$v_k$$$ ($$$1 \leq v_i \leq n$$$) — the vertexes in the subsequence. If there are multiple shortest subsequences, print any. Any two consecutive numbers should be distinct.     dp      graphs      greedy      shortest paths      *1700
