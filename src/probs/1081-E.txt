E. Missing Numberstime 2  256 Chouti is working on a strange math problem.There was a sequence of $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$$$, where $$$n$$$ is even. The sequence was very special, namely for every integer $$$t$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, $$$x_1+x_2+...+x_t$$$ is a square of some integer number (that is, a perfect square).Somehow, the numbers with odd indexes turned to be missing, so he is only aware of numbers on even positions, i.e. $$$x_2, x_4, x_6, \ldots, x_n$$$. The task for him is to restore the original sequence. Again, it's your turn to help him.The problem setter might make mistakes, so there can be no possible sequence at all. If there are several possible sequences, you can output any.InputThe first line contains an even number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^5$$$).The second line contains $$$\frac{n}{2}$$$ positive integers $$$x_2, x_4, \ldots, x_n$$$ ($$$1 \le x_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).OutputIf there are no possible sequence, print "No".Otherwise, print "Yes" and then $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$$$ ($$$1 \le x_i \le 10^{13}$$$), where $$$x_2, x_4, \ldots, x_n$$$ should be same as in input data. If there are multiple answers, print any.Note, that the limit for $$$x_i$$$ is larger than for input data. It can be proved that in case there is an answer, there must be a possible sequence satisfying $$$1 \le x_i \le 10^{13}$$$.     binary search      constructive algorithms      greedy      math      number theory      *1900
