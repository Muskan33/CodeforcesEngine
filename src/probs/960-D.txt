D. Full Binary Tree Queriestime 4  256 You have a full binary tree having infinite levels.Each node has an initial value. If a node has value x, then its left child has value 2·x and its right child has value 2·x + 1. The value of the root is 1. You need to answer Q queries. There are 3 types of queries:  Cyclically shift the values of all nodes on the same level as node with value X by K units. (The values/nodes of any other level are not affected). Cyclically shift the nodes on the same level as node with value X by K units. (The subtrees of these nodes will move along with them). Print the value of every node encountered on the simple path from the node with value X to the root.Positive K implies right cyclic shift and negative K implies left cyclic shift. It is guaranteed that atleast one type 3 query is present.InputThe first line contains a single integer Q (1 ≤ Q ≤ 105).Then Q queries follow, one per line:  Queries of type 1 and 2 have the following format: T X K (1 ≤ T ≤ 2; 1 ≤ X ≤ 1018; 0 ≤ |K| ≤ 1018), where T is type of the query. Queries of type 3 have the following format: 3 X (1 ≤ X ≤ 1018).OutputFor each query of type 3, print the values of all nodes encountered in descending order.     brute force      implementation      trees      *2100
