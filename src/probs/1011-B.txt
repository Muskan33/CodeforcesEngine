B. Planning The Expeditiontime 1 secondmemory 256 Natasha is planning an expedition to Mars for $$$n$$$ people. One of the important tasks is to provide food for each participant.The warehouse has $$$m$$$ daily food packages. Each package has some food type $$$a_i$$$.Each participant must eat exactly one food package each day. Due to extreme loads, each participant must eat the same food type throughout the expedition. Different participants may eat different (or the same) types of food.Formally, for each participant $$$j$$$ Natasha should select his food type $$$b_j$$$ and each day $$$j$$$-th participant will eat one food package of type $$$b_j$$$. The values $$$b_j$$$ for different participants may be different.What is the maximum possible number of days the expedition can last, following the requirements above?InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$, $$$1 \le m \le 100$$$) — the number of the expedition participants and the number of the daily food packages available.The second line contains sequence of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_m$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 100$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the type of $$$i$$$-th food package.OutputPrint the single integer — the number of days the expedition can last. If it is not possible to plan the expedition for even one day, print 0.     binary search      brute force      implementation      *1200
