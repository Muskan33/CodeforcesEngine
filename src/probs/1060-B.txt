B. Maximum Sum of Digitstime 2  512 You are given a positive integer $$$n$$$.Let $$$S(x)$$$ be sum of digits in base 10 representation of $$$x$$$, for example, $$$S(123) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6$$$, $$$S(0) = 0$$$.Your task is to find two integers $$$a, b$$$, such that $$$0 \leq a, b \leq n$$$, $$$a + b = n$$$ and $$$S(a) + S(b)$$$ is the largest possible among all such pairs.InputThe only line of input contains an integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \leq n \leq 10^{12})$$$.OutputPrint largest $$$S(a) + S(b)$$$ among all pairs of integers $$$a, b$$$, such that $$$0 \leq a, b \leq n$$$ and $$$a + b = n$$$.     greedy      *1100
