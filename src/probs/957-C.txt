C. Three-level Lasertime 1 secondmemory 256 An atom of element X can exist in n distinct states with energies E1 < E2 < ... < En. Arkady wants to build a laser on this element, using a three-level scheme. Here is a simplified description of the scheme. Three distinct states i, j and k are selected, where i < j < k. After that the following process happens:   initially the atom is in the state i, we spend Ek - Ei energy to put the atom in the state k, the atom emits a photon with useful energy Ek - Ej and changes its state to the state j, the atom spontaneously changes its state to the state i, losing energy Ej - Ei, the process repeats from step 1. Let's define the energy conversion efficiency as , i. e. the ration between the useful energy of the photon and spent energy.Due to some limitations, Arkady can only choose such three states that Ek - Ei ≤ U.Help Arkady to find such the maximum possible energy conversion efficiency within the above constraints.InputThe first line contains two integers n and U (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ U ≤ 109) — the number of states and the maximum possible difference between Ek and Ei.The second line contains a sequence of integers E1, E2, ..., En (1 ≤ E1 < E2... < En ≤ 109). It is guaranteed that all Ei are given in increasing order.OutputIf it is not possible to choose three states that satisfy all constraints, print -1.Otherwise, print one real number η — the maximum possible energy conversion efficiency. Your answer is considered correct its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 9.Formally, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b.
