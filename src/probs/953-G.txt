G. Large Bouquetstime 1 secondmemory 256 A flower shop has got n bouquets, and the i-th bouquet consists of ai flowers. Vasya, the manager of the shop, decided to make large bouquets from these bouquets. Vasya thinks that a bouquet is large if it is made of two or more initial bouquets, and there is a constraint: the total number of flowers in a large bouquet should be odd. Each of the initial bouquets can be a part of at most one large bouquet. If an initial bouquet becomes a part of a large bouquet, all its flowers are included in the large bouquet.Determine the maximum possible number of large bouquets Vasya can make. InputThe first line contains a single positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of initial bouquets.The second line contains a sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 106) — the number of flowers in each of the initial bouquets.OutputPrint the maximum number of large bouquets Vasya can make.      *1500
