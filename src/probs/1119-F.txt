F. Niyaz and Small Degreestime 3  256 Niyaz has a tree with $$$n$$$ vertices numerated from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. A tree is a connected graph without cycles.Each edge in this tree has strictly positive integer weight. A degree of a vertex is the number of edges adjacent to this vertex.Niyaz does not like when vertices in the tree have too large degrees. For each $$$x$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$(n-1)$$$, he wants to find the smallest total weight of a set of edges to be deleted so that degrees of all vertices become at most $$$x$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 250\,000$$$) — the number of vertices in Niyaz's tree.Each of the next $$$(n - 1)$$$ lines contains three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \le a, b \le n$$$, $$$1 \leq c \leq 10^6$$$) — the indices of the vertices connected by this edge and its weight, respectively. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.OutputPrint $$$n$$$ integers: for each $$$x = 0, 1, \ldots, (n-1)$$$ print the smallest total weight of such a set of edges that after one deletes the edges from the set, the degrees of all vertices become less than or equal to $$$x$$$.     data structures      dp      trees      *3400
