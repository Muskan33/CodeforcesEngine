E. Sonya and Matrix Beautytime 1.5  256 Sonya had a birthday recently. She was presented with the matrix of size $$$n\times m$$$ and consist of lowercase Latin letters. We assume that the rows are numbered by integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from bottom to top, and the columns are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ from left to right. Let's call a submatrix $$$(i_1, j_1, i_2, j_2)$$$ $$$(1\leq i_1\leq i_2\leq n; 1\leq j_1\leq j_2\leq m)$$$ elements $$$a_{ij}$$$ of this matrix, such that $$$i_1\leq i\leq i_2$$$ and $$$j_1\leq j\leq j_2$$$. Sonya states that a submatrix is beautiful if we can independently reorder the characters in each row (not in column) so that all rows and columns of this submatrix form palidroms. Let's recall that a string is called palindrome if it reads the same from left to right and from right to left. For example, strings $$$abacaba, bcaacb, a$$$ are palindromes while strings $$$abca, acbba, ab$$$ are not.Help Sonya to find the number of beautiful submatrixes. Submatrixes are different if there is an element that belongs to only one submatrix.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ $$$(1\leq n, m\leq 250)$$$ — the matrix dimensions.Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ lowercase Latin letters.OutputPrint one integer — the number of beautiful submatrixes.     strings      *2400
