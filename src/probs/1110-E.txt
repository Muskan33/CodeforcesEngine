E. Magic Stonestime 1 secondmemory 256 Grigory has $$$n$$$ magic stones, conveniently numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The charge of the $$$i$$$-th stone is equal to $$$c_i$$$.Sometimes Grigory gets bored and selects some inner stone (that is, some stone with index $$$i$$$, where $$$2 \le i \le n - 1$$$), and after that synchronizes it with neighboring stones. After that, the chosen stone loses its own charge, but acquires the charges from neighboring stones. In other words, its charge $$$c_i$$$ changes to $$$c_i' = c_{i + 1} + c_{i - 1} - c_i$$$.Andrew, Grigory's friend, also has $$$n$$$ stones with charges $$$t_i$$$. Grigory is curious, whether there exists a sequence of zero or more synchronization operations, which transforms charges of Grigory's stones into charges of corresponding Andrew's stones, that is, changes $$$c_i$$$ into $$$t_i$$$ for all $$$i$$$?InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the number of magic stones.The second line contains integers $$$c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$$$ ($$$0 \le c_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9$$$) — the charges of Grigory's stones.The second line contains integers $$$t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n$$$ ($$$0 \le t_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9$$$) — the charges of Andrew's stones.OutputIf there exists a (possibly empty) sequence of synchronization operations, which changes all charges to the required ones, print "Yes".Otherwise, print "No".     constructive algorithms      math      sortings      *2200
