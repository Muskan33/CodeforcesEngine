G. Polygonstime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$.You need to construct $$$k$$$ regular polygons having same circumcircle, with distinct number of sides $$$l$$$ between $$$3$$$ and $$$n$$$.   Illustration for the first example. You can rotate them to minimize the total number of distinct points on the circle. Find the minimum number of such points.InputThe only line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 10^{6}$$$, $$$1 \le k \le n-2$$$), the maximum number of sides of a polygon and the number of polygons to construct, respectively.OutputPrint a single integer â€” the minimum number of points required for $$$k$$$ polygons.     greedy      math      number theory      *2800
