E. Pavel and Trianglestime 2  256 Pavel has several sticks with lengths equal to powers of two.He has $$$a_0$$$ sticks of length $$$2^0 = 1$$$, $$$a_1$$$ sticks of length $$$2^1 = 2$$$, ..., $$$a_{n-1}$$$ sticks of length $$$2^{n-1}$$$. Pavel wants to make the maximum possible number of triangles using these sticks. The triangles should have strictly positive area, each stick can be used in at most one triangle.It is forbidden to break sticks, and each triangle should consist of exactly three sticks.Find the maximum possible number of triangles.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 300\,000$$$) — the number of different lengths of sticks.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_0$$$, $$$a_1$$$, ..., $$$a_{n-1}$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ is the number of sticks with the length equal to $$$2^i$$$.OutputPrint a single integer — the maximum possible number of non-degenerate triangles that Pavel can make.     brute force      dp      fft      greedy      ternary search      *1900
