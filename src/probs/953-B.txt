B. Add Pointstime 1 secondmemory 256 There are n points on a straight line, and the i-th point among them is located at xi. All these coordinates are distinct.Determine the number m — the smallest number of points you should add on the line to make the distances between all neighboring points equal. InputThe first line contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of points.The second line contains a sequence of integers x1, x2, ..., xn ( - 109 ≤ xi ≤ 109) — the coordinates of the points. All these coordinates are distinct. The points can be given in an arbitrary order.OutputPrint a single integer m — the smallest number of points you should add on the line to make the distances between all neighboring points equal.      *1800
