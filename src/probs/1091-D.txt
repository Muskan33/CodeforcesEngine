D. New Year and the Permutation Concatenationtime 2  256 Let $$$n$$$ be an integer. Consider all permutations on integers $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in lexicographic order, and concatenate them into one big sequence $$$p$$$. For example, if $$$n = 3$$$, then $$$p = [1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1]$$$. The length of this sequence will be $$$n \cdot n!$$$.Let $$$1 \leq i \leq j \leq n \cdot n!$$$ be a pair of indices. We call the sequence $$$(p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{j-1}, p_j)$$$ a subarray of $$$p$$$. Its length is defined as the number of its elements, i.e., $$$j - i + 1$$$. Its sum is the sum of all its elements, i.e., $$$\sum_{k=i}^j p_k$$$. You are given $$$n$$$. Find the number of subarrays of $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$ having sum $$$\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$$. Since this number may be large, output it modulo $$$998244353$$$ (a prime number). InputThe only line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^6$$$), as described in the problem statement.OutputOutput a single integer — the number of subarrays of length $$$n$$$ having sum $$$\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$$, modulo $$$998244353$$$.     combinatorics      dp      math      *1700
