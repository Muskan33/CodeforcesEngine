A. You Are Given Two Binary Strings...time 2  256 You are given two binary strings $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, which are binary representations of some two integers (let's denote these integers as $$$f(x)$$$ and $$$f(y)$$$). You can choose any integer $$$k \ge 0$$$, calculate the expression $$$s_k = f(x) + f(y) \cdot 2^k$$$ and write the binary representation of $$$s_k$$$ in reverse order (let's denote it as $$$rev_k$$$). For example, let $$$x = 1010$$$ and $$$y = 11$$$; you've chosen $$$k = 1$$$ and, since $$$2^1 = 10_2$$$, so $$$s_k = 1010_2 + 11_2 \cdot 10_2 = 10000_2$$$ and $$$rev_k = 00001$$$.For given $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, you need to choose such $$$k$$$ that $$$rev_k$$$ is lexicographically minimal (read notes if you don't know what does "lexicographically" means).It's guaranteed that, with given constraints, $$$k$$$ exists and is finite.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \le T \le 100$$$) â€” the number of queries.Next $$$2T$$$ lines contain a description of queries: two lines per query. The first line contains one binary string $$$x$$$, consisting of no more than $$$10^5$$$ characters. Each character is either 0 or 1.The second line contains one binary string $$$y$$$, consisting of no more than $$$10^5$$$ characters. Each character is either 0 or 1.It's guaranteed, that $$$1 \le f(y) \le f(x)$$$ (where $$$f(x)$$$ is the integer represented by $$$x$$$, and $$$f(y)$$$ is the integer represented by $$$y$$$), both representations don't have any leading zeroes, the total length of $$$x$$$ over all queries doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$, and the total length of $$$y$$$ over all queries doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputPrint $$$T$$$ integers (one per query). For each query print such $$$k$$$ that $$$rev_k$$$ is lexicographically minimal     bitmasks      greedy      *1100
