A. Enlarge GCDtime 1 secondmemory 256 Mr. F has $$$n$$$ positive integers, $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$.He thinks the greatest common divisor of these integers is too small. So he wants to enlarge it by removing some of the integers.But this problem is too simple for him, so he does not want to do it by himself. If you help him, he will give you some scores in reward.Your task is to calculate the minimum number of integers you need to remove so that the greatest common divisor of the remaining integers is bigger than that of all integers.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of integers Mr. F has.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers, $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 1.5 \cdot 10^7$$$).OutputPrint an integer — the minimum number of integers you need to remove so that the greatest common divisor of the remaining integers is bigger than that of all integers.You should not remove all of the integers.If there is no solution, print «-1» (without quotes).     number theory      *1800
