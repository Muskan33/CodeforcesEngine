A. Thanos Sorttime 1 secondmemory 256 Thanos sort is a supervillain sorting algorithm, which works as follows: if the array is not sorted, snap your fingers* to remove the first or the second half of the items, and repeat the process.Given an input array, what is the size of the longest sorted array you can obtain from it using Thanos sort?*Infinity Gauntlet required.InputThe first line of input contains a single number $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 16$$$) — the size of the array. $$$n$$$ is guaranteed to be a power of 2.The second line of input contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 100$$$) — the elements of the array.OutputReturn the maximal length of a sorted array you can obtain using Thanos sort. The elements of the array have to be sorted in non-decreasing order.     implementation
