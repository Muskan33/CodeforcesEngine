A. A pile of stonestime 1 secondmemory 256 Vasya has a pile, that consists of some number of stones. $$$n$$$ times he either took one stone from the pile or added one stone to the pile. The pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile.You are given $$$n$$$ operations which Vasya has made. Find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations.InputThe first line contains one positive integer $$$n$$$ — the number of operations, that have been made by Vasya ($$$1 \leq n \leq 100$$$).The next line contains the string $$$s$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ symbols, equal to "-" (without quotes) or "+" (without quotes). If Vasya took the stone on $$$i$$$-th operation, $$$s_i$$$ is equal to "-" (without quotes), if added, $$$s_i$$$ is equal to "+" (without quotes).OutputPrint one integer — the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after these $$$n$$$ operations.     implementation      math      *800
