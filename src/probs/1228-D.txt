D. Complete Tripartitetime 2  256 You have a simple undirected graph consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges. The graph doesn't contain self-loops, there is at most one edge between a pair of vertices. The given graph can be disconnected.Let's make a definition.Let $$$v_1$$$ and $$$v_2$$$ be two some nonempty subsets of vertices that do not intersect. Let $$$f(v_{1}, v_{2})$$$ be true if and only if all the conditions are satisfied:  There are no edges with both endpoints in vertex set $$$v_1$$$.  There are no edges with both endpoints in vertex set $$$v_2$$$.  For every two vertices $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ such that $$$x$$$ is in $$$v_1$$$ and $$$y$$$ is in $$$v_2$$$, there is an edge between $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. Create three vertex sets ($$$v_{1}$$$, $$$v_{2}$$$, $$$v_{3}$$$) which satisfy the conditions below;  All vertex sets should not be empty.  Each vertex should be assigned to only one vertex set.  $$$f(v_{1}, v_{2})$$$, $$$f(v_{2}, v_{3})$$$, $$$f(v_{3}, v_{1})$$$ are all true. Is it possible to create such three vertex sets? If it's possible, print matching vertex set for each vertex.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 10^{5}$$$, $$$0 \le m \le \text{min}(3 \cdot 10^{5}, \frac{n(n-1)}{2})$$$) — the number of vertices and edges in the graph.The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains two integers $$$a_{i}$$$ and $$$b_{i}$$$ ($$$1 \le a_{i} \lt b_{i} \le n$$$) — it means there is an edge between $$$a_{i}$$$ and $$$b_{i}$$$. The graph doesn't contain self-loops, there is at most one edge between a pair of vertices. The given graph can be disconnected.OutputIf the answer exists, print $$$n$$$ integers. $$$i$$$-th integer means the vertex set number (from $$$1$$$ to $$$3$$$) of $$$i$$$-th vertex. Otherwise, print $$$-1$$$.If there are multiple answers, print any.     brute force      constructive algorithms      graphs      hashing      implementation      *1900
