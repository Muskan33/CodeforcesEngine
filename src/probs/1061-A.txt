A. Coinstime 2  256 You have unlimited number of coins with values $$$1, 2, \ldots, n$$$. You want to select some set of coins having the total value of $$$S$$$. It is allowed to have multiple coins with the same value in the set. What is the minimum number of coins required to get sum $$$S$$$?InputThe only line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$S$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100\,000$$$, $$$1 \le S \le 10^9$$$)OutputPrint exactly one integer — the minimum number of coins required to obtain sum $$$S$$$.     greedy      implementation      math      *800
