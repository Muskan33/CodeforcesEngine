B. Ehab and subtractiontime 1 secondmemory 256 You're given an array $$$a$$$. You should repeat the following operation $$$k$$$ times: find the minimum non-zero element in the array, print it, and then subtract it from all the non-zero elements of the array. If all the elements are 0s, just print 0.InputThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ $$$(1 \le n,k \le 10^5)$$$, the length of the array and the number of operations you should perform.The second line contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ $$$(1 \le a_i \le 10^9)$$$, the elements of the array.OutputPrint the minimum non-zero element before each operation in a new line.     implementation      sortings      *1000
