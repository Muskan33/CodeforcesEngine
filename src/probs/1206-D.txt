D. Shortest Cycletime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given $$$n$$$ integer numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$. Consider graph on $$$n$$$ nodes, in which nodes $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ ($$$i\neq j$$$) are connected if and only if, $$$a_i$$$ AND $$$a_j\neq 0$$$, where AND denotes the bitwise AND operation.Find the length of the shortest cycle in this graph or determine that it doesn't have cycles at all.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \le n \le 10^5)$$$ — number of numbers.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integer numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 10^{18}$$$).OutputIf the graph doesn't have any cycles, output $$$-1$$$. Else output the length of the shortest cycle.     bitmasks      graphs      *1900
