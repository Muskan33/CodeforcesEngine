B. Game with stringtime 1 secondmemory 256 Two people are playing a game with a string $$$s$$$, consisting of lowercase latin letters. On a player's turn, he should choose two consecutive equal letters in the string and delete them. For example, if the string is equal to "xaax" than there is only one possible turn: delete "aa", so the string will become "xx". A player not able to make a turn loses.Your task is to determine which player will win if both play optimally.InputThe only line contains the string $$$s$$$, consisting of lowercase latin letters ($$$1 \leq |s| \leq 100\,000$$$), where $$$|s|$$$ means the length of a string $$$s$$$.OutputIf the first player wins, print "Yes".
