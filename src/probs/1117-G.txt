G. Recursive Queriestime 4  256 You are given a permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$$$. You should answer $$$q$$$ queries. Each query is a pair $$$(l_i, r_i)$$$, and you should calculate $$$f(l_i, r_i)$$$.Let's denote $$$m_{l, r}$$$ as the position of the maximum in subsegment $$$p_l, p_{l+1}, \dots, p_r$$$.Then $$$f(l, r) = (r - l + 1) + f(l, m_{l,r} - 1) + f(m_{l,r} + 1, r)$$$ if $$$l \le r$$$ or $$$0$$$ otherwise.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^6$$$, $$$1 \le q \le 10^6$$$) — the size of the permutation $$$p$$$ and the number of queries.The second line contains $$$n$$$ pairwise distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \le p_i \le n$$$, $$$p_i \neq p_j$$$ for $$$i \neq j$$$) — permutation $$$p$$$.The third line contains $$$q$$$ integers $$$l_1, l_2, \dots, l_q$$$ — the first parts of the queries.The fourth line contains $$$q$$$ integers $$$r_1, r_2, \dots, r_q$$$ — the second parts of the queries.It's guaranteed that $$$1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$$$ for all queries.OutputPrint $$$q$$$ integers — the values $$$f(l_i, r_i)$$$ for the corresponding queries     data structures      *2500
