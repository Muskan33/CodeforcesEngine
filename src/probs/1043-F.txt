F. Make It Onetime 3  256 Janusz is a businessman. He owns a company "Januszex", which produces games for teenagers. Last hit of Januszex was a cool one-person game "Make it one". The player is given a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$.It is allowed to select any subset of them, and the score is equal to the greatest common divisor of selected elements. The goal is to take as little elements as it is possible, getting the score $$$1$$$. Now Janusz wonders, for given sequence, how much elements should the player choose?InputThe first line contains an only integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 300\,000$$$) — the number of integers in the sequence.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 300\,000$$$).OutputIf there is no subset of the given sequence with gcd equal to $$$1$$$, output -1.Otherwise, output exactly one integer — the size of the smallest subset with gcd equal to $$$1$$$.     bitmasks      combinatorics      dp      math      number theory      shortest paths      *2500
