E. Minimizing Differencetime 2  256 You are given a sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers.You may perform the following operation on this sequence: choose any element and either increase or decrease it by one.Calculate the minimum possible difference between the maximum element and the minimum element in the sequence, if you can perform the aforementioned operation no more than $$$k$$$ times.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ $$$(2 \le n \le 10^{5}, 1 \le k \le 10^{14})$$$ â€” the number of elements in the sequence and the maximum number of times you can perform the operation, respectively.The second line contains a sequence of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ $$$(1 \le a_i \le 10^{9})$$$.OutputPrint the minimum possible difference between the maximum element and the minimum element in the sequence, if you can perform the aforementioned operation no more than $$$k$$$ times.     binary search      constructive algorithms      greedy      sortings      ternary search      two pointers      *2000
