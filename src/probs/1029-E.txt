E. Tree with Small Distancestime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given an undirected tree consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices. An undirected tree is a connected undirected graph with $$$n - 1$$$ edges.Your task is to add the minimum number of edges in such a way that the length of the shortest path from the vertex $$$1$$$ to any other vertex is at most $$$2$$$. Note that you are not allowed to add loops and multiple edges.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree.The following $$$n - 1$$$ lines contain edges: edge $$$i$$$ is given as a pair of vertices $$$u_i, v_i$$$ ($$$1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$$$). It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree. It is guaranteed that there are no loops and multiple edges in the given edges.OutputPrint a single integer — the minimum number of edges you have to add in order to make the shortest distance from the vertex $$$1$$$ to any other vertex at most $$$2$$$. Note that you are not allowed to add loops and multiple edges.     dp      graphs      greedy      *2100
