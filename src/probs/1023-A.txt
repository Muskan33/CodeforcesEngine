A. Single Wildcard Pattern Matchingtime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given two strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$. The string $$$s$$$ consists of lowercase Latin letters and at most one wildcard character '*', the string $$$t$$$ consists only of lowercase Latin letters. The length of the string $$$s$$$ equals $$$n$$$, the length of the string $$$t$$$ equals $$$m$$$.The wildcard character '*' in the string $$$s$$$ (if any) can be replaced with an arbitrary sequence (possibly empty) of lowercase Latin letters. No other character of $$$s$$$ can be replaced with anything. If it is possible to replace a wildcard character '*' in $$$s$$$ to obtain a string $$$t$$$, then the string $$$t$$$ matches the pattern $$$s$$$.For example, if $$$s=$$$"aba*aba" then the following strings match it "abaaba", "abacaba" and "abazzzaba", but the following strings do not match: "ababa", "abcaaba", "codeforces", "aba1aba", "aba?aba".If the given string $$$t$$$ matches the given string $$$s$$$, print "YES", otherwise print "NO".InputThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) â€” the length of the string $$$s$$$ and the length of the string $$$t$$$, respectively.The second line contains string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, which consists of lowercase Latin letters and at most one wildcard character '*'.The third line contains string $$$t$$$ of length $$$m$$$, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters.OutputPrint "YES" (without quotes), if you can obtain the string $$$t$$$ from the string $$$s$$$. Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).     brute force      implementation      strings      *1200
