G. Appropriate Teamtime 2  256 Since next season are coming, you'd like to form a team from two or three participants. There are $$$n$$$ candidates, the $$$i$$$-th candidate has rank $$$a_i$$$. But you have weird requirements for your teammates: if you have rank $$$v$$$ and have chosen the $$$i$$$-th and $$$j$$$-th candidate, then $$$GCD(v, a_i) = X$$$ and $$$LCM(v, a_j) = Y$$$ must be met.You are very experienced, so you can change your rank to any non-negative integer but $$$X$$$ and $$$Y$$$ are tied with your birthdate, so they are fixed.Now you want to know, how many are there pairs $$$(i, j)$$$ such that there exists an integer $$$v$$$ meeting the following constraints: $$$GCD(v, a_i) = X$$$ and $$$LCM(v, a_j) = Y$$$. It's possible that $$$i = j$$$ and you form a team of two.$$$GCD$$$ is the greatest common divisor of two number, $$$LCM$$$ — the least common multiple.InputFirst line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$X$$$ and $$$Y$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \le X \le Y \le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of candidates and corresponding constants.Second line contains $$$n$$$ space separated integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^{18}$$$) — ranks of candidates.OutputPrint the only integer — the number of pairs $$$(i, j)$$$ such that there exists an integer $$$v$$$ meeting the following constraints: $$$GCD(v, a_i) = X$$$ and $$$LCM(v, a_j) = Y$$$. It's possible that $$$i = j$$$.     bitmasks      math      number theory      *2700
