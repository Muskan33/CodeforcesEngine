F. Cowmpany Cowmpensationtime 2  256 Allen, having graduated from the MOO Institute of Techcowlogy (MIT), has started a startup! Allen is the president of his startup. He also hires $$$n-1$$$ other employees, each of which is assigned a direct superior. If $$$u$$$ is a superior of $$$v$$$ and $$$v$$$ is a superior of $$$w$$$ then also $$$u$$$ is a superior of $$$w$$$. Additionally, there are no $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ such that $$$u$$$ is the superior of $$$v$$$ and $$$v$$$ is the superior of $$$u$$$. Allen himself has no superior. Allen is employee number $$$1$$$, and the others are employee numbers $$$2$$$ through $$$n$$$.Finally, Allen must assign salaries to each employee in the company including himself. Due to budget constraints, each employee's salary is an integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$D$$$. Additionally, no employee can make strictly more than his superior.Help Allen find the number of ways to assign salaries. As this number may be large, output it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.InputThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 3000$$$, $$$1 \le D \le 10^9$$$).The remaining $$$n-1$$$ lines each contain a single positive integer, where the $$$i$$$-th line contains the integer $$$p_i$$$ ($$$1 \le p_i \le i$$$). $$$p_i$$$ denotes the direct superior of employee $$$i+1$$$.OutputOutput a single integer: the number of ways to assign salaries modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.     combinatorics      dp      math      trees      *2700
