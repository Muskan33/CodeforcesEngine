F. Bits And Piecestime 2  256 You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers.You need to find the maximum value of $$$a_{i} | ( a_{j} \& a_{k} )$$$ over all triplets $$$(i,j,k)$$$ such that $$$i < j < k$$$.Here $$$\&$$$ denotes the bitwise AND operation, and $$$|$$$ denotes the bitwise OR operation.InputThe first line of input contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 10^{6}$$$), the size of the array $$$a$$$.Next line contains $$$n$$$ space separated integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_{i} \le 2 \cdot 10^{6}$$$), representing the elements of the array $$$a$$$.OutputOutput a single integer, the maximum value of the expression given in the statement.      bitmasks      dfs and similar      dp      greedy      *2600
