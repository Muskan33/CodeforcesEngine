H. Holy Diver time 3  1024 You are given an array which is initially empty. You need to perform $$$n$$$ operations of the given format:   "$$$a$$$ $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$ $$$k$$$": append $$$a$$$ to the end of the array. After that count the number of integer pairs $$$x, y$$$ such that $$$l \leq x \leq y \leq r$$$ and $$$\operatorname{mex}(a_{x}, a_{x+1}, \ldots, a_{y}) = k$$$. The elements of the array are numerated from $$$1$$$ in the order they are added to the array.To make this problem more tricky we don't say your real parameters of the queries. Instead your are given $$$a'$$$, $$$l'$$$, $$$r'$$$, $$$k'$$$. To get $$$a$$$, $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$, $$$k$$$ on the $$$i$$$-th operation you need to perform the following:   $$$a := (a' + lans) \bmod(n + 1)$$$,  $$$l := (l' + lans) \bmod{i} + 1$$$,  $$$r := (r' + lans) \bmod{i} + 1$$$,  if $$$l > r$$$ swap $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$,  $$$k := (k' + lans) \bmod(n + 1)$$$,  where $$$lans$$$ is the answer to the previous operation, initially $$$lans$$$ is equal to zero. $$$i$$$ is the id of the operation, operations are numbered from $$$1$$$.The $$$\operatorname{mex}(S)$$$, where $$$S$$$ is a multiset of non-negative integers, is the smallest non-negative integer which does not appear in the set. For example, $$$\operatorname{mex}(\{2, 2, 3\}) = 0$$$ and $$$\operatorname{mex} (\{0, 1, 4, 1, 6\}) = 2$$$. InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array.The next $$$n$$$ lines contain the description of queries.Each of them $$$n$$$ lines contains four non-negative integers $$$a'$$$, $$$l'$$$, $$$r'$$$, $$$k'$$$ ($$$0, \leq a', l', r', k' \leq 10^9$$$), describing one operation.OutputFor each query print a single integer — the answer to this query.     data structures      *3500
