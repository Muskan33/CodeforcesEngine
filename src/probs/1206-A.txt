A. Choose Two Numberstime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given an array $$$A$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$, and an array $$$B$$$, consisting of $$$m$$$ positive integers $$$b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m$$$. Choose some element $$$a$$$ of $$$A$$$ and some element $$$b$$$ of $$$B$$$ such that $$$a+b$$$ doesn't belong to $$$A$$$ and doesn't belong to $$$B$$$. For example, if $$$A = [2, 1, 7]$$$ and $$$B = [1, 3, 4]$$$, we can choose $$$1$$$ from $$$A$$$ and $$$4$$$ from $$$B$$$, as number $$$5 = 1 + 4$$$ doesn't belong to $$$A$$$ and doesn't belong to $$$B$$$. However, we can't choose $$$2$$$ from $$$A$$$ and $$$1$$$ from $$$B$$$, as $$$3 = 2 + 1$$$ belongs to $$$B$$$.It can be shown that such a pair exists. If there are multiple answers, print any.Choose and print any such two numbers.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\le n \le 100$$$) — the number of elements of $$$A$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 200$$$) — the elements of $$$A$$$.The third line contains one integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1\le m \le 100$$$) — the number of elements of $$$B$$$.The fourth line contains $$$m$$$ different integers $$$b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i \le 200$$$) — the elements of $$$B$$$.It can be shown that the answer always exists.OutputOutput two numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ such that $$$a$$$ belongs to $$$A$$$, $$$b$$$ belongs to $$$B$$$, but $$$a+b$$$ doesn't belong to nor $$$A$$$ neither $$$B$$$.If there are multiple answers, print any.     math      sortings      *800
