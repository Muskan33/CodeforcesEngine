B. Mystical Mosaictime 1 secondmemory 256 There is a rectangular grid of n rows of m initially-white cells each.Arkady performed a certain number (possibly zero) of operations on it. In the i-th operation, a non-empty subset of rows Ri and a non-empty subset of columns Ci are chosen. For each row r in Ri and each column c in Ci, the intersection of row r and column c is coloured black.There's another constraint: a row or a column can only be chosen at most once among all operations. In other words, it means that no pair of (i, j) (i < j) exists such that  or , where  denotes intersection of sets, and  denotes the empty set.You are to determine whether a valid sequence of operations exists that produces a given final grid.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 50) — the number of rows and columns of the grid, respectively.Each of the following n lines contains a string of m characters, each being either '.' (denoting a white cell) or '#' (denoting a black cell), representing the desired setup.OutputIf the given grid can be achieved by any valid sequence of operations, output "Yes"; otherwise output "No" (both without quotes).You can print each character in any case (upper or lower).     brute force      greedy      implementation      *1300
