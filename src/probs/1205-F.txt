F. Beauty of a Permutationtime 2  256 Define the beauty of a permutation of numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ $$$(p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n)$$$ as number of pairs $$$(L, R)$$$ such that $$$1 \le L \le R \le n$$$ and numbers $$$p_L, p_{L+1}, \dots, p_R$$$ are consecutive $$$R-L+1$$$ numbers in some order. For example, the beauty of the permutation $$$(1, 2, 5, 3, 4)$$$ equals $$$9$$$, and segments, corresponding to pairs, are $$$[1]$$$, $$$[2]$$$, $$$[5]$$$, $$$[4]$$$, $$$[3]$$$, $$$[1, 2]$$$, $$$[3, 4]$$$, $$$[5, 3, 4]$$$, $$$[1, 2, 5, 3, 4]$$$.Answer $$$q$$$ independent queries. In each query, you will be given integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$. Determine if there exists a permutation of numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ with beauty equal to $$$k$$$, and if there exists, output one of them.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1\le q \le 10\,000$$$) — the number of queries.Follow $$$q$$$ lines. Each line contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$, $$$1 \le k \le \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$$) — the length of permutation and needed beauty respectively.OutputFor a query output "NO", if such a permutation doesn't exist. Otherwise, output "YES", and in the next line output $$$n$$$ numbers — elements of permutation in the right order.     constructive algorithms      math      *3400
