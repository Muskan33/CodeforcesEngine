F. You Are Given Some Letters...time 1 secondmemory 256 You are given $$$a$$$ uppercase Latin letters 'A' and $$$b$$$ letters 'B'.The period of the string is the smallest such positive integer $$$k$$$ that $$$s_i = s_{i~mod~k}$$$ ($$$0$$$-indexed) for each $$$i$$$. Note that this implies that $$$k$$$ won't always divide $$$a+b = |s|$$$.For example, the period of string "ABAABAA" is $$$3$$$, the period of "AAAA" is $$$1$$$, and the period of "AABBB" is $$$5$$$.Find the number of different periods over all possible strings with $$$a$$$ letters 'A' and $$$b$$$ letters 'B'.InputThe first line contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \le a, b \le 10^9$$$) â€” the number of letters 'A' and 'B', respectively.OutputPrint the number of different periods over all possible strings with $$$a$$$ letters 'A' and $$$b$$$ letters 'B'.     binary search      implementation      math      *2700
