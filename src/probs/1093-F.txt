F. Vasya and Arraytime 2  512 Vasya has got an array consisting of $$$n$$$ integers, and two integers $$$k$$$ and $$$len$$$ in addition. All numbers in the array are either between $$$1$$$ and $$$k$$$ (inclusive), or equal to $$$-1$$$. The array is good if there is no segment of $$$len$$$ consecutive equal numbers.Vasya will replace each $$$-1$$$ with some number from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$ (inclusive) in such a way that the resulting array is good. Tell him the number of ways to do this replacement. Since the answer may be large, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.InputThe first line contains three integers $$$n, k$$$ and $$$len$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5, 1 \le k \le 100, 1 \le len \le n$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ numbers — the array. Each number is either $$$-1$$$ or between $$$1$$$ and $$$k$$$ (inclusive).OutputPrint one integer — the number of ways to replace each $$$-1$$$ with some number from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$ (inclusive) so the array is good. The answer may be large, so print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.     dp      *2400
