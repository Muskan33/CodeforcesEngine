A. From Hero to Zerotime 1 secondmemory 256 You are given an integer $$$n$$$ and an integer $$$k$$$.In one step you can do one of the following moves:   decrease $$$n$$$ by $$$1$$$;  divide $$$n$$$ by $$$k$$$ if $$$n$$$ is divisible by $$$k$$$. For example, if $$$n = 27$$$ and $$$k = 3$$$ you can do the following steps: $$$27 \rightarrow 26 \rightarrow 25 \rightarrow 24 \rightarrow 8 \rightarrow 7 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 0$$$.You are asked to calculate the minimum number of steps to reach $$$0$$$ from $$$n$$$. InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) â€” the number of queries.The only line of each query contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^{18}$$$, $$$2 \le k \le 10^{18}$$$).OutputFor each query print the minimum number of steps to reach $$$0$$$ from $$$n$$$ in single line.     implementation      math      *900
